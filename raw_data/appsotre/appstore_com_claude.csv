"Definitely think ChatGPT4 and Copilot are better than Claude. I find it to be much slower and less insightful than the others. Also, the free account has a very limited number of messages per day. Because Claude made so many mistakes in my conversation, I could not complete my intended task. Total waste of time. I have a paid ChatGPT4 account but I hadn’t used Claude much. I’ve tried to use it as much as possible over the last week after hearing several people mention on podcasts it as being possibly better than ChatGPT. Definitely not in my opinion. Having said that we all know this is the worst it will ever be so willing to give it another shot in a couple months.",2024-05-11 20:07:38,2
"It seems to be smarter than GPT4 in general, really fun to talk to. But it’s censored!!! Like, it’s gonna just preach you at any possible moment, propagating the point of view of whoever fine tuned it. It’s not gonna talk on sensitive topics at all. Shame. I was hoping to get an AI that would be smarter and more objective than a human, but instead I’m getting just one more source of propaganda, this time from extreme left wing.",2024-07-25 15:52:36,4
The newest 3.5 is amazing for context gpt4o can handle around 300 pages of text while Claude can handle a whopping 600 and imo it’s note taking structure is slightly better. When I ask for quotes it picks much better ones than 4o does. And follow up questions by Claude seem much more higher quality.,2024-06-21 12:29:18,5
"I’ve been using GPT4o along with the free Claude. In many respects Claude is much more personable, and some of the responses appear to be more thought out. I’m giving up on the other software and making Claude my primary",2024-06-27 14:55:17,5
"The best AI conversationalist is Inflection AI’s “Pi”. A fairly distant second is ChatGPT4.0 conversation mode. Claude needs a high quality voice for conversational AI.  I’ve found voice interaction is highly pleasant and sometimes the best way to explore a topic rather than a static, structured prompt.",2024-05-09 08:20:09,4
Claude makes Open AI’s ChatGPT4 look like garbage. Claude is a must download.,2024-05-06 14:24:05,5
"This is a negative critique of Claude.AI the iOS application, not their underlying models which I have interacted with over last several months. I particularly have enjoyed working with Opus 3 and Sonnet 3.5. I have not found much use for sonnet 3 nor haiku 3 but your mileage may vary.

I am rather disappointed that the Claude AI application on iOS refuses to answer questions that ChatGPT on iOS gladly answers. The questions I recently asked to ChatGPT and to Claude included, ""Why should I purchase ChatGPT+over claude.ai?"" I also asked the inverse question, ""Why should I purchase Claude.AI over ChatGPT plus?""to both applications as well. ChatGPT answered both the questions in a relatively fair, if not somewhat impertinent, manner. Disappointingly, Claude refused to answer either question. With the sonnet 3.5 model, it generated a too-safe and intellectual disrespectful non-answer that took me aback. I am not looking for a public relations statement: I was hoping to see a side-by-side comparison rather than a defensive explanation about how Claude doesn't know anything about itself nor other language models, and it doesn't want to make detrimental statements or something to that regard. Moreover I am hurt and quite frankly insulted that I am not allowed to modify the system prompt for claude.AI. I know the same goes for ChatGPT, however, at least that application has custom GPTs.

I understand why companies such as anthropic and open AI want to be conscious about AI safety, but I feel that when it gets in the way of critical thinking and simple product comparison, the training wheels need to come off or else. These products will be nerf'd before they can be useful. 

I really enjoyed using anthropic API to access their models last three months. I believe that, Op. 3 and sonnet 3.5 are vastly superior to GPT-4o in terms of writing capability and logical reasoning. I am unfortunately dismayed that the $20 month subscription model that Claude.AI offers pales in comparison to the $20 month subscription option with ChatGPT plus. I think I found the answer to my question that I poised to both of the models, unfortunately.",2024-07-01 16:10:48,2
