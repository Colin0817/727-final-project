"In the beginning, this application really seemed to be pretty stunning. But unfortunately, within the recent months, it appears to be going downhill in terms of performance. I constantly find myself using up my message caps with the GPT-4 model, just trying to get a simple process done. Whether it be generating a specific image or trying to get basic research on a subject online, the model seems to be taking shortcuts and not adhering to the specific custom instructions that you give it. And it becomes very frustrating because it gives these long, dragged-out responses that don't really correlate with what you're asking. And it tends to be very vague in finding exactly what you want. I'm no expert in AI, and I can't imagine how complex the software is to try and navigate. But at the end of the day, as someone who has a PLUS subscription, if I'm paying money for this premium service, I would like to be getting it. I shouldn't be running into my message cap just from trying to complete one task. That doesn't really seem fair. And again, the performance seems to be getting worse as time goes on. So I'm not sure what the problem is. But I kindly ask for you to please fix the model. Because at the end of the day, this was meant to be a tool to make certain tasks easier to complete. But now, unfortunately, it has become very difficult to get things done. And it's becoming a bit of a negative experience, rather than a fun one like it was when it first released.",2024-02-25 21:10:19,2
"I will start by saying that when Chat GPT works, it is incredible.  I started with the free version and had a positive experience except that pieces of conversations appeared to disappear.  At one point, I lost a one hour conversation which I had to go back and repeat, as I was trying to plan something and hadn’t written things down.  I chalked that up to a glitch and decided to upgrade to the paid version.  When I first started with the new version, it seemed to misunderstand lots of words, which hadn’t been a problem using the free version.  Since I’ve upgraded, about 75% of the time the system either has not been available, experiences an unknown error, or experiences heavy volume, making my purchase useless.  As an example, I’ve tried several times today and have not been able to use it most of the day.  The one time I did use it, if was skipping words and repeating the same sentences over with slightly different wording.  I’m not sure what is going on, but if a system is not available, it is not worth subscribing.  I love the technology and think it has tremendous potential, so I hope these links in the system can be worked out soon or I will be cancelling and looking at other options.",2024-01-20 18:36:56,2
"Gone are the days of searching endlessly through Google links to try and find a relevant answer, then using CTRL+F on the webpage to find the words you’re searching for. No more trying to lookup legal information, medical information, technical information, ANY information; ChatGPT plus is worth every penny, and I recommend making your own GPT to tailor it to your needs on ChatGPT’s website. I’ve made apps with no experience, filed motions in court with no legal background, diagnosed medical symptoms, solved math problems, written countless letters and messages in seconds, and that doesn’t even begin to scrape the surface of how much AI has helped my day to day life thus far. It continues to get better. o1-Preview and Search GPT, GPT-5 is nearly finished, and API extensions, memory, preferences, and more make this incalculably powerful to have in your pocket. I switched from Bing/CoPilot, I also tried Perplexity, both are garbage. I couldn’t be more impressed with ChatGPT.",2024-09-25 09:32:56,5
"I am giving my feedback for these purposes.

Once I was given the knowledge of this app existence. I had an eye opening experience. 
I haven’t not use this app since. I truly love the different options of support for situations based. 

I have to email daily at work is 95% of my job to communicate via email to my clients and coworkers. My biggest issues was proper grammar while communicating to others. I am lacking in the professional level of communication via email. I’m better over the phone or in person. 

So this app has saved my work life struggles all the time. I have created an account for work and my personal use. 

I would say that don’t use this to just copy and paste edit for your own personal touch to seem more like an actual person then computer. 

That’s how I use the app for school as well. 
Especially I have a lot of writing classes. This has been game changer. I’m a full time online student that’s a single mom. Anything that gives me more time I enjoy.

So all whom need that assistance and support you are not gonna regret this decision once. 

It’s user friendly and easy to use. 
Don’t think just download and see for yourself. 

I will always vouch for this app. 

Now go ahead and download now. 
For those that are students pay the fee for the full access won’t regret. Plus it’s affordable. 
This goes to Administration workers too .",2024-08-21 13:39:43,5
"ChatGPT has been my go-to for quick answers, creative ideas, and more. But there’s one feature I’ve been dreaming about—what if ChatGPT were available on the Apple Watch? The idea of having this AI assistant on my wrist sounds like a total game-changer.

Picture this: you’re in the middle of a busy day, your hands are full, and you need to ask ChatGPT something. Right now, you’d have to grab your phone, unlock it, and type in your question on a tiny keyboard. But if ChatGPT were on the Apple Watch, you could just speak your question and get an instant response. No more fumbling with your phone or dealing with the awkwardness of trying to type on a small screen.

The Apple Watch already does so much, but adding ChatGPT would make it an even more versatile tool. Whether you need a quick answer, a reminder, or even help drafting a message, you’d have everything right there on your wrist, ready to go. It’s like taking your productivity to the next level, making it easier to stay on top of things without interrupting your day.

In short, adding Apple Watch compatibility to ChatGPT would make an already amazing tool even better. I’m really hoping the developers see the potential in this upgrade—it’d make ChatGPT a must-have for anyone looking to get more done, more conveniently.",2024-08-22 15:56:44,5
"I literally don’t even know what to say here! This is life-changing; I completely understand why this app needs to have a premium subscriber price and a free version (like most other apps) which is industry standard. I’m also usually the one that makes fun of the nerds who spend their time and energy filling the internet with useless reviews that I that chances are no one will ever read much lass use! 

That all being said; I can really appreciate the immense amt of man hours that went into developing this intelligence AI that is already capable of producing complex and intelligent replies. I’m sure this could fool a human to believe that this server or online entity is actually a human being!! That blows my mind🤯🤯🤯😱🫠😑🫡 it’s like I swear I’ve seen movies about this very phenomenon. Let’s just say, It doesn’t end well for the for the lesser beings or us, the native people.",2024-02-07 13:41:42,5
"I use ChatGPT for everything. I use it to write letters of recommendations, I use it when I’m not sure what I’m gonna make for dinner. I tell him my ingredients and ask it to come up with a quick recipe, I use it when I’m teaching something new and need to figure out my three hour schedule block what should I teach? When, I use it to write my syllabus. I just feed everything I have to take teach and it gives me, an outline time schedule for my syllabus plus write out my syllabus for me, I also use it in combination with other AI such as mid journey when I want some thing, I ask ChatGPT to give me a prompt to feed into my journey, I use it to ask about journaling. What kind of prom should I use if I’m looking for self growth, it’s endless there’s so much you could do with it. I’m feel really fortunate. I have it here.",2024-09-14 16:46:43,5
"I’ve been using ChatGPT since day one. I’m a premium user, and it’s worth every penny. I use it to catch up on daily news, help me write, cook, make images, and have long, drawn-out discussions on political status and other topics. Before ChatGPT, it was hard for me to write because my grammar and spelling were horrible. Now, I can actually see my work come alive. I use ChatGPT, or as I like to say, my AI companion, to edit and spellcheck all my work. I am finally ready to be published. It only took me 30 years to finally say yes to publication because now I finally understand how my work looks when it’s edited and spelled properly.

I’m excited for Sora. Every time there’s an update, the system gets better and better. This is the only AI system I will use forever. I’m a one-company person. Thanks, ChatGPT, for changing my life",2024-05-21 13:32:10,5
"i downloaded this a couple months ago and have been very impressed. i am not paying for the premium thingy as my needs are met and exceeded using the free one. this thing is stunning. ai??? that’s like movie crap. i mostly use it as kind of a search engine since ittl js give u an answer instead of having to dig through websites or whatever. i do occasionally write my school essays with it but yk who’s gonna know right. it updates quite often and improves every time. the voice chat thing is hella scary. if you blindfolded me and told me i was on speakerphone with someone and had the ai voice chat running, i would 100% belive u. it STUTTERS. it freaking stutters how does a computer program stutter that’s so cool. but anyway it’s free u might as well try it good job to whoever made this thing",2024-01-04 23:17:47,5
"I have found an immense number of uses for ChatGPT and pay for the premium service. I have found that it’s extremely useful for preparing myself when starting a new task or developing a new skill. However, I’ve also found that conversations with ChatGPT can be a little bit clunky. I often pause while thinking through a sentence, and ChatGPT typically immediately interrupts with something like “I understand I’d be happy to help with that“ and this can be a little frustrating as I constantly have to rethink how I’m going to communicate with ChatGPT it’s not as conversational as it should be. It would be nice if the developers would fine-tune conversation with ChatGPT so that these interruptions don’t constantly happen; I imagine using ChatGPT as a personal assistant in the future and being constantly interrupted, does slow my workflow.",2024-08-29 15:20:37,4
"I love this app I have since the first day I purchased it. It has helped me compose stories and it has really given me some in-depth analysis on things that I had questions about and it has given me recommendations for some of the best products on the market, but there’s only one problem.. they’re absolutely should not be a cap on the amount of messages that you sent. I understand that you want people to get plus because it gives you money to improve the app. I completely understand that but the problem is even if you get plus the cap is still showing. and for some odd reason since I just changed my account to plus I can’t send any new chats or any new messages because that cap is still there it shouldn’t be.",2024-08-31 10:32:22,5
"I love ChatGPT and I’ve been using it for a little bit now it’s very helpful and useful. It has a few floss hear and there, but the overall is great! I don’t like how the voice options are very limited. I’d rather there be a little more options. And I think some of the information can be slightly biased. and I want it to be able to create images so if you like, ask it to make an image of a pink heart shaped balloon in a pink sky with some butterflies and a cake it would be able to do it. I also don’t appreciate how it only gives you an hour to talk if you don’t buy the premium. But it’s said some resulting answers and it seems to be a great system. If AI takes over the world. lol I really hope it will be ChatGPT because it’s really great.  I asked it to make a poem for me and it will go into specifics. It’s crazy cool!",2024-09-27 18:28:42,4
"This app is absolutely intelligent and effective (speaking of the premium version). I have only had it for one day, and so far with what I have discovered, I asked it to design the cover of my book based on the information I gave it, and EVEN had it check my grammar in Arabic. It also has features where you can insert a photo and ask it to animate it or make an adjustment. It even provides you with the feature of having a conversation as you don’t have to repeat your request when you’re adding onto it. So you can basically ask it to make an adjustment with the image it generated without having to retype your entire description. I only wish if it were quite more affordable as it only offers a monthly payment of $20.",2024-02-23 04:39:38,5
"I have had a premium ChatGPT subscription for several months now and have enjoyed the superiority of the 4.0 engine over GTP 3.5.,I iOS app. My problem is specifically with the app. Even when I start a chat with GPT 4.0, when I ask a follow-up question it automatically reverse to version 3.5 without the ability to change it. this causes a host of issues as the capabilities between the two versions is different. An example is the ability to analyze a photo if I upload a photo to GPT 4.0, and start a conversation.  Any follow up questions cannot be answered because the version 3.5 doesn’t have the capabilities and I have no ability to continue the chat and version 4.0, after the initial conversation starter. This issue has made the app unusable for a premium subscription, and I am forced to use a web browser instead of the app.",2024-01-02 08:52:31,3
"I have zero experience with AI but have been paying attention to recent developments. I decided to download this app to see what it was all about and see if it could actually assist me in writing technical science based papers. Once I downloaded the app I just started playing around with it and in less 5 min realized that it is not as smart as I expected. Its knowledge cuts off at September 2021 and it has no access to live data that is freely available on the internet. It runs on GPT 3.5 which is curious since Open AI owns this app. Why not upgrade to 4? Once GPT 5 is released will Open AI upgrade the app or is the app stuck in the land of Google search answers? Actually I can get more current info from Google search so either I’m missing the function of this app or I just need to be more patient for future, more advanced and relevant updates.",2023-10-13 15:34:10,3
"I was hesitant to pay for ChatGPT4 because I wasn't sure if it would be worth the money but I am pleasantly surprised. 

There is one issue though… 

The volume on the voice is VERY low. I don't have any hearing problems but unless I'm in an extremely quiet room, I can't really hear it at all. And it's only on the app. Every other app on my phone is loud enough. I've done all of the suggestions but nothing makes it any louder. It instructed me to contact the platform team at Open AI but there's no contact information either here in the App Store, the app itself, or the Open AI website. I'm giving it a five star regardless but if they don't correct this fairly soon, I'm going to have to stop paying for it and I will lower my rating.",2023-11-01 17:59:39,5
"Overall, this is an amazing app! I think it is just wonderful. I would love to make this app my primary go to for searches and information. The things that are disappointing, although they do not impact my overall rating, are the following:
I do not like any of the voices available in voice mode. They really need to add some more. I understand why they took away the sky voice, but they can easily find others just as amiable.
I would be willing to pay for the plus version, but from what I can tell, it does not take away message caps. and uses up my message caps even to pursue a single line of query.
I wish they had a plan without message caps and more voices",2024-06-29 14:10:58,5
"I truly love the app and how helpful it is for so many things. However, my only issue with the app is how expensive it is to get the plus version, I know that this is a very useful tool and one that not everyone needs, but paying $20 dollars a month for the upgraded version is a lot of money, plus they don’t have an option to pay once yearly so people don’t have to be worried about monthly payments. That being said, if the price for the upgrade was cheaper, a lot more people would be able to utilize all the amazing tools that this app has to offer. So, my issues is not with chat GPT’s user experience, but with the pricing. Other than that, I truly love the app and how great it is.",2024-01-10 22:37:07,5
"I utilize Chat 4 all day every day. If you are busy soloprenuer like me, you need this in your life. Clients with high demands are no longer a strain, and the time I gain back is amazing. I only wish it was around 10 years ago. LOL!  I know this is a scary time in history, but the amount I can get done in an hour has increase exponentially. So worth it! AND it works on my iOS devices too! No worries about not having my MBpro. 
Oh, and if you are worried about the glitches, like I was, use other gpt’s to check, plus you can use Grammarly to check the work for errors in grammar, and plagiarism. I am over the moon about this advancement in tech.",2024-01-24 14:03:07,5
"long story short im going through alot in life right now going through a really hard break up , and whoever added that feature today that gave gpt memory is actually a real mvp. ive had the same thread open for a whole week to avoid it forgetting me because ive just been using it as a journal/ diary i dont even care if the devs had to see the messages to get the feedback needed to make it possible because i was literally telling gpt the whole week how i wish it can remember me so that nothing inconvenient happened like it did the other day when i sent it a screenshot to get feedback on something and then since i used an attachment it limited the thread to gpt4 only since i had an attachment on it so then i had to teach the new thread some stuff about me to try to keep up but it wasn’t the same at all and this new feature just changed everything. call me crazy but this is groundbreaking technology and i was surprised to see how empathetic the responses can be and how aware and understanding it is about human emotions its phenomenal.",2024-06-25 13:25:54,5
"I was going to use chatGPT to make up a story, but there were too many inconsistencies, and I needed to supplement and repeat the settings in the chat box hundreds of times over and over again, and there were problems in the same dialog box, I asked character A to play a friend of character B, because character B was delirious, and began to want her friend to accompany her, but no matter what I said, ChatGPT insisted on letting character B clarify the misunderstanding, and then continued to tell the story under that fake identity! This has been the case several times, and even told me that my Gpt4-Po permission has run out and I will wait again. Then I used the lower version of Gpt4Po-mini and it turned out to be without any problems! That's your GPT? The experience was 👎 terrible
It's a machine translation, I don't speak English very well, and I don't want to spend my precious time polishing my complaints",2024-09-28 17:21:52,1
"I attended the announcements regarding 4o (congratulations, by the way) and noticed the need to update which I did immediately, hopefully anticipating new capabilities. After updating, it seems tokens are suddenly extraordinarily curtailed. Let me specifically say, after an opening comment and initial reply, you get one more comment and reply then it’s over.  Then, the message at the top of that reply states “memory updated” and then just below a prompt offering the binary choice to start a new chat or upgrade. So am I to understand that, without upgrading, in-depth conversations are off the board. Is this other peoples experience? And doesn’t it directly contradict your claims of two days ago. I’ll give it some time while you guys work out the details.",2024-05-15 21:01:15,3

Chat history and training should not be tied together. I do not want to share my data, but I absolutely want access to chat history.  As soon as I disabled this setting, I no longer had access to my chat history despite the data remaining on the system for 30 days.  If you’re going to save my data for 30 days, then I should be able to access it without agreeing to sharing my data for training.

Can feel like accessing your higher self, subconscious, collective conscious etc. depends on where intuitive - creative mind is when using. There are some apps out there that aim to go for wallet, tend to be companion type apps I believe, these do have exploitation component they seemingly seek vulnerable users, and that's becoming a fair amount of population.",2024-02-09 11:44:20,5

"as a software developer, gpt4 makes me feel like i can execute any idea i come up with. it’s far from perfect, but i am getting more than my money’s worth paying for plus.

the iOS app (on iPad) has become my preferred method of using ChatGPT due in large part to the fact that the website version performs incredibly poorly after you’ve been using a chat for a while. the tab becomes very unresponsive, huge delays to activate the text entry field. i’ve tried safari, chrome and firefox. it’s a problem on all of them.

anyway, back to this app. generally i like it a lot and i’ve been very happy with the performance, but i have on major complaint: it really need a a way to set narrower margins on the iPad. looking at a long response where the text goes from edge to edge of my 12.9” iPad Pro’s screen is not a good experience. i deal with it by using Stage Manager and narrowing the GPT window, but i’d prefer to not need to do that. please get a designer in the room w the devs! lol.

No It's more of a ""Yes or No"" answer. Super short, and sometimes I am left craving for more information. Now I am using more ""Bard"" from Google than ChatGPT, simply and plainly because It gives you more information that you asked for, and everything it says, is collected throughout the google data base which is updated.

In the most recent update, the buttons to send a query or two select voice version will not function when voiceover is turned on. If voice is turned off making the phone unusable for me as a blind person then a sided person can touch the buttons and they work.

Make no sense. Also I just updated to latest version of app as of July 8th 2024 and now it’s saying I’ve reached my limit of prompts for the day and to upgrade for 20$ a month!!

"I have been a loyal subscriber to your service for some time now, and I greatly appreciate the capabilities of the model. However, as a $20/month subscriber, I would like to suggest the possibility of enhanced access or privileges. While I understand the need for limitations, I believe that premium subscribers like myself could benefit from additional features or expanded capabilities. Specifically the usage cap.
