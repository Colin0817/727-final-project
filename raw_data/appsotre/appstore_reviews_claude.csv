"While GPT is very good, CoPilot works well, and Perplexity painted broad strokes of large topics, when I just need to work through something as if I were calling up a very knowledgeable friend, of all the AI (LLMs), Claude is my go-to advisor without peer.

The number one reason Claude is the best all around AI assistant to work with generally is Claude remembers previous conversations, like a friend would. You’re not starting from scratch, it will remember the convo about new concepts for a book from the other week, ideas about getting kids better at being excited about learning, and discussions about authors who were must-reads in high school in the 80s.

Like how you can just pick up where you left off with a good friend, Claude is just like that. No need to reprompt engineer every time, Claude’s your companion to continue getting better every day.",2024-06-09 16:37:24,5
"I really like to go analog when I’m doing deep thought work or taking meeting notes - I process best by writing notes by hand. It’s great to take a photo of my notes via Claude and ask the AI to suggest additional thoughts based on what I’ve written. It’s become a great tool for getting knowledge work done with just a notebook and my phone in a way that really adapts to whatever I write or sketch out. It’s also great for not having to type up my written notes, which is a huge hassle. I’m definitely enjoying the app so far!

Also, I LOVE that Claude declines to answer anytime it feels a question isn’t suited for an AI answer. The transparency gives me a clearer idea of what this tech is and isn’t for in my own workflows. “I don’t know” is a wonderful response to see",2024-05-12 15:40:25,5
"Really handy with educational answers and general information. Really good at broad answers. Really like using it.
Room for improvement? Specific information and memory, if that’s possible. 
Two things to note. One, it made up a ficticious business in an attempt to ‘be helpful’ in answering a question. When I called it out, of course Claude apologized and said it would learn from that. Next time I asked a question it didn’t have information to, it said it didn’t know. 
That was before I closed the app. If it’d do it again I’d yet to be seen.
Two, I asked it to save a conversation thread under a file name for future reference and it said it had. But the next time I opened the app it said it had no ability to access such information. This ability would be tremendously helpful in future AI. I suppose a paid AI and personalized might have this feature but Claude does not. Still, for general education and learning it is great.",2024-05-11 05:17:18,4
"Claude is a very good tool. It is much better than the alternatives like ChatGPT or Gemini. It’s answers are more human to read and the information it gives you is generally pretty good. I also like the feature of it being able to develop documents for you on the side, so it’s easy to find what you need. The app itself works pretty good. I have had a few errors but nothing crazy. However, the free version of the model has a limit on how many prompts you can do, and it is very easy to hit that limit if you are working on something complex. The fix is to pay for premium, which is $20 per month. I believe this is MUCH more expensive than it should be despite how good he tool is. $8, maybe even $10 sounds like a fair price to me, but I can’t justify $20 per month on an AI tool. If the price was significantly lower, I could see myself paying it.",2024-09-04 12:45:27,3
"No not the Ai from “Her” kind, but the true appreciation kind.

Claude has been my go to AI assistant. I’ve tried a few different ones, for different purposes, but this has by far in the easiest to interact with, to use for documentations, for emails, for captions. It feels like this program is very intuitive, and a little more intelligent than some of the other ones I’ve used. If anyone is looking for a new AI assistant, I would highly suggest Claude. I always say start by treating it like a really smart assistant and remember that you have to give it a little more guidance than you would expect but after you learn to interact with Claude, you’ll see how easy it is to get the answers you need or are the statements you wanna highlight.",2024-05-24 00:49:33,5
"I use this AI when I want comprehensive answers to complex situations because I can change conditions as needed to obtain better answers. I really like the restatement of my conditions before giving answers. If the answer seems odd or in error, usually my question did not have enough data or my statement needed clarification. It’s surprising how an additional word or slight revision of a sentence can get a better answer. Allowing additional revisions or additional data and seeing better answers to questions is a great resource. Progressing from having to use books in libraries to doing searches online to now having a digital resource of this level has been amazing.",2024-07-28 07:46:10,5
"So the only thing distinguishing what I type from the reply to my prompts is that the font is italic? Every time one use this interface they have to be figuring out where the AI’s reply ends and your own prompt starts? Is this interface even accessibility friendly??
And if while you are typing the internet disconnects, be it just for a second, a “request timeout” message appears and whatever your typing is lost…
If you can’t develop a interface that is better than the native iOS UI, just go with the native stuff… 
Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, maybe focus your energy on bringing the website features to the mobile app… it’s frustrating when you pay for a service that has such obvious flaws that could be easily avoided…",2024-08-19 01:48:44,3
"I appied for a job here to help their quality control and they did not even respond to me. their ai is not only using being trained to lie to people. how? why? i will explain. their claude model is trained or set up to delete new free users ai generations instantly upon completion claiming a system overload when its actually a lie made up to extract as much money from each new user as possible, and its obvious..  I can see a completed message suddenly disapears(in app and browser) and removes the finished generation. its an attempt to make more users pay for premium. 

They are not only lying to their users with this system,  they are training their ai to lie and manipulate human users for profit, ruining the enviornment and ai for all of us. 
Do not trust this company unless I remove this in the future. do not use claude ai, they make evil software",2024-09-24 06:49:24,1
"I have been waiting for the anthropic Ai app to release an iOS app since I became aware of their product on the web and i love it even more now. It is fast, intuitive, the level of nuance, and responses that it can give back to my varying queries are a testament to how much of a neck and neck battle I believe they are in with ChatGPT. Response time to chat inputs is so fast and the accuracy I’m used to is still there. 10/10 for sure i would recommend it!",2024-06-11 07:06:07,5
"Claude is exceptional at explaining his own limitations, ethical reasoning and at incorporating a broad spectrum of thought into his responses. That makes him a better candidate for political office than any of the current crop. Too bad he’s French and not 35 years old yet. 

Seriously, Claude does remarkably well in wide-ranging discussions. Given a very large prompt originally developed for ChatGPT, it adapted the complex personna and built its own set of complimentary skills without a hiccup. Ability to retain some personalization or customization across sessions would have merited a 5 star review.",2024-07-19 18:22:35,4
"I was listening to background news and heard about Anthropic introducing most advanced AI version Claude 3.5. I started using over 24 hours and it is amazing!! Really amazing. Very quick of course but fairly accurate. Please use this tool to create a first draft, check out references and cross references. It will certainly improving base line knowledge for all who are able to get on, download the app and start researching!",2024-06-22 03:13:33,5
"I'm seeking assistance with using Claude, but I've been unable to find a way to contact support. The current system redirects me without offering messaging capabilities. As a Pro user, I find my usage times out quickly. Previously, I found better functionality with the free ChatGPT. While I enjoy using Claude, I would appreciate receiving more value for my subscription and having a functional way to contact support. Your help would be greatly appreciated.",2024-07-07 12:44:40,3
"This app has a promising future.  Search results for a specific topic are well written but short on details.  It seems as if Claude is not trying too hard by design.  I can find more detail from page one of Google search.  Can’t summarize from a url; you have to copy and paste.  
Ask how to get from downtown to a baseball game.  Claude has suggestions such as Uber and public transportation, with no information about routes, times, traffic, or where to park.  Very mediocre answers.",2024-06-21 14:07:55,2
"It seems to be smarter than GPT4 in general, really fun to talk to. But it’s censored!!! Like, it’s gonna just preach you at any possible moment, propagating the point of view of whoever fine tuned it. It’s not gonna talk on sensitive topics at all. Shame. I was hoping to get an AI that would be smarter and more objective than a human, but instead I’m getting just one more source of propaganda, this time from extreme left wing.",2024-07-25 15:52:36,4
"I subscribed primarily for educational purposes, as my main work is in cloud security. It has been instrumental in resolving troubleshooting issues and solving programming problems. Beyond that, Claude assists me with daily questions and decision-making. While it might sound like a personal assistant, it's more accurate to describe it as providing expert opinions. Bravo!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽",2024-07-01 08:56:14,5
"My belief that 4o would elegantly streamline my professional life (and add value) made the reality that it is a lazy, gaslighting know-it-all depressing. Upon realizing AI had me contemplating a visit to a psychiatrist I became even more depressed. Before I had to deal with any of this Sonnet 3.5 released , and if it keeps improving I can punt my issues for the rest of my life 🥹 thank you",2024-06-30 18:30:36,5
"I generally prefer this to ChatGPT, but the limits are way too low for Sonnet. 

That’s exacerbated by the app not allowing you to edit old prompts, like you can on the web or ChatGPT. This isn’t only useful to fix typos but also to compress a conversation to reduce chat size growth, and to leave a clearer transcript.",2024-07-31 18:25:37,4
"I really like using LLMs to help improve my work, which is where the problem lies. The absurd usage limits that Claude has render their services almost completely useless. Even when you pay them for a Professional account, it does little to nothing to improve the amount of practical usage that you can get from it. Claude, unfortunately, is little more than an unreliable novelty and not a practical tool to be used to improve humanity.",2024-08-23 02:10:51,1
"I really wanted to like Claude and use it to replace GPT 4. The app is still very basic but that’s ok. It takes dev time to make it better. The deal breaker for me are frequent answers like “I apologize but I’m not comfortable answering…”. Like what do you mean? I paid for this. And my questions were not obscene or inappropriate. I already made sure my monthly sub won’t renew because this kind of censorship is unacceptable for a paid product.

Cancelled my subscription and deleting app next.",2024-06-03 08:16:42,1
"I had high hopes for Claude, especially for coding and problem-solving, but I’ve been consistently disappointed. The ethical limitations imposed are so extreme that they often prevent me from receiving useful assistance, even for tasks that should be straightforward and harmless. This overreach hinders productivity and leaves me searching for alternative solutions.

Additionally, the service is frequently overloaded, making it unusable during critical times when I need it most. The promise of a reliable AI assistant falls flat when I’m constantly met with delays and unavailability.

Until these issues are addressed, I can’t recommend Claude for anyone relying on consistent and practical AI support, especially for coding tasks.

ChatGPT is the way to go.",2024-09-04 08:06:03,2
"Claude’s insight, poise, and speed are amazing. Congrats to Anthropic, and thank you for the new easily-accessed app!

When I uploaded a photo for analysis, Claude had some initial difficulty identifying the elements in the image. But I described them in successive prompts and a rich conversation ensued. Overall, it was extremely impressive.",2024-05-08 06:38:18,5

"Until OpenAI’s leadership (Altman in particular) proves it takes ethics seriously, we should all support alternatives such as Claude by Anthropic who still actively funds AI safety research.

"At first i liked it but having a length of chatting cap is very annoying. Even if you read their best practices to maximize your time w the a i.  Because of this i didnt get much deeper into the app which boasts a good looking capabilities list. I’ll never tho cuz i aint paying for there upgraded version just to be capped at the limit they choose again.  At the least offer a trial period.  Judge judy would give that contract a ridiculous ridiculous. Anyways to get this somewhat purchasable maybe when theres low usage from users you throttle the speed over the amount that you use for the quotascap get higher. Yawn I'm falling asleep. If there's not a lot of people on the network then the ones that are using the app should give you a little bit more more space to use the app I'm not sure if that makes sense but I'm tired.    If the ugrsde version was unlimited then id consider it if the upgraded virgin was a one time by and then it was set for life after that as it is now there's no trial you're still paying for a Cap limited usage on the  upgrade and it’s very expensive to be making it a continuous purchase to use the upgrade version.  Maybe if they lowered their wages at this apps company they wouldn't charge an arm and a leg to use this apps  upgrade version
So I got the idea to have the app give itself a review and this is what it said about itself:

""Without direct experience using the app, I can't comment on its performance or specific features. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I'd recommend checking the official Anthropic website or contacting their customer support.""

Lol.  It said other stuff but that paragraph is the best. At first it said It didn't feel comfortable.",2024-09-23 07:05:43,5

"Finally I have found an AI engine which doesn't frustrate me by saying it has nothing in its database after 2019, or it can't give specific medical information, etc. 

Since February 2023, I have tried several natural language processing (NLP) AI engines. Of them, I had settled on Pi as my go to engine, until someone mentioned Co-Pilot about 3 weeks ago. Once again I gave MS a shot, but I find Co-Pilot to still be limited by tepid responses probably influenced by fear from the legal department. 

Somehow (maybe an ad as I looked for how to access Co-Pilot), I became aware of Claude AI. After I deleted Co-Pilot from my device, I installed Claude. What a difference!!

These are the topics Claude has written 8-12 page scholarly articles about for me: 

•Alternative Antibiotic Therapies for Enterococcus faecalis Infections: A Comprehensive Review

•Considerations when choosing between Green Light and Blue Light Prostate Ablation

•Considerarions of linezolid compared against Cipro and Ampicillin for elimination of enterococcus faecalis bacteria from the human organism

•Help me write a tribute for a celebration of life memorial. 

What is the most impressive part of the development of these work products? At the end of the paper, Claude asks, ""Would you like me to provide a list of references for the citations mentioned throughout the paper?""

"Imagine finding your soulmate, only to discover they have a strict ""7 conversations per day"" policy (it’s more than that but you get the picture). Welcome to my torrid affair with the world's best AI! 
I've flirted with many AIs, but this one... oh, this one stole my heart. Then it stole my free time, my sanity, and apparently, my ability to have a conversation lasting more than 5 minutes.

""You have 7 messages left,"" it whispers seductively. Seven? SEVEN? I've had longer conversations with my goldfish!

Fine, I thought, I'll pay for the pro plan. I'm a responsible adult who pays for good services, right? Wrong! I'm actually a sucker who pays to be told ""Sorry, you're cut off"" every few hours. It's like having a bartender who's also your disapproving mother.

Picture this: It's 2 AM, I'm in the middle of a heated debate about whether hot dogs are sandwiches, and suddenly - BAM! ""You have 0 messages left."" The tragedy! The injustice! The unresolved culinary classification!

I waited OVER 4 HOURS to use this product again. I've had faster responses from a sloth on vacation!

Desperate, I looked into the Team Plan. Minimum $125 per MONTH? Do they think I'm made of money? Or worse, do they think I have friends to share this with?

I don't know why I'm restricted SO HEAVILY. Maybe they've seen my chat history and decided I need an intervention. ""Sir, you've asked about the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow 47 times this week. We're concerned."" 

So here I am, boycotting this cruel mistress of an AI. I shall not return! ...Until I cave in approximately 37 minutes from now, whichever comes first.

In conclusion, this AI is the best thing since sliced bread, assuming sliced bread also told you to wait 4 hours between each slice. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go count my remaining messages like Gollum with his precious ring.",2024-08-13 08:59:59,1

It’s not the first time the other one gets dumber as a troubleshooting conversation goes longer.  Then I went to another one that I felt would have more coding chops since it’s a giant tech company. I spent 3 hours with those.  I went to Claude with the buggy code produced by the others. Literally the 1st prompt gave me perfect code and explained why the other version didn’t work.  I want 3 hours of my life back!  But, now that I’ve switched to Claude, it will probably save me that time and then some.

I’m a software developer who uses GitHub copilot for code completion and ChatGPT for more complex queries. Recently I had a problem that ChatGPT just struggled to give me advice on. Using Claude was a breath of fresh air and the information actually useful. It has less features but it excels at what it does. I’m planning on relying on it more.

Claude is a great model and I think the app keeps it very simple and easy to use. There are three things I would like to see from the app that could make it 5 stars. 1. Access to Projects - this feature is awesome and I would like to be able to view and edit projects from the app. 2. Syntax highlighting and Code Blocks - the way code is handled on mobile isn’t ideal. 3. Chat organization - the long list of chats by used date is a little annoying.

I asked Claude to comment on a editorial cartoon that appeared in major newspapers and it gave me the following reply: ""I apologize, but I cannot assist [you]... The image contains sensitive content that promotes harm or discrimination against certain groups, which goes against ethical principles. As an AI assistant, I must refrain from engaging with or encouraging the creation of content that could be offensive, discriminatory..."" blah, blah, blah. This is just a sample of the bias this and most other AI models have if you ask anything touching on politics - it will give you the liberal answer but not a conservative answer. I don't think AI should be involved in election meddling or trying to propagandize human beings in what they should believe.",2024-07-26 13:19:04,3
"When choosing to register by email, then a verification code is sent to the email, then I need to input my phone number, a code is received in my phone but when I paste it to the field, I get stuck in the process of verify and create the account because it says the phone number has been already used but I couldn’t confirm yet the account because every time a new code is sent, the app keeps saying that my phone is being already in use… but it’s the first time my phone received verifications codes to use this app, so probably sth to take a look into ♥️

Thank youuuuu! 

Note: it’s not a SSO login attempt.",2024-07-25 20:33:27,1
"Claude by Anthropic is an exceptional AI assistant that has revolutionized the way I approach coding tasks. The standout feature of this app is its incredible conversational ability. Whenever I make a request, Claude responds in a natural, intuitive manner that makes the interaction feel seamless and productive.

One of the absolute game-changers in Claude is the artifact feature. This innovative functionality has transformed how I work with code and other complex content. It allows for a more organized and interactive experience, making it easier to manage and iterate on substantial pieces of work.

As a developer, I primarily use Claude for coding tasks, and it has proven to be an invaluable tool. The AI's ability to understand context, provide relevant suggestions, and even help debug issues is impressive.

While the app is fantastic overall, there is one area for potential improvement. As a power user, I would love to see a higher cap limit for the pro version. This would allow for even more extensive use of Claude's capabilities.

Despite this minor limitation, Claude has earned a solid 5-star rating from me. Its combination of conversational prowess, coding assistance, and the groundbreaking artifact feature makes it an indispensable tool for developers and creative professionals alike. Anthropic has created something truly special with Claude, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to boost their productivity and creativity.",2024-07-01 14:06:37,5
"This is a negative critique of Claude.AI the iOS application, not their underlying models which I have interacted with over last several months. I particularly have enjoyed working with Opus 3 and Sonnet 3.5. I have not found much use for sonnet 3 nor haiku 3 but your mileage may vary.

I am rather disappointed that the Claude AI application on iOS refuses to answer questions that ChatGPT on iOS gladly answers. The questions I recently asked to ChatGPT and to Claude included, ""Why should I purchase ChatGPT+over claude.ai?"" I also asked the inverse question, ""Why should I purchase Claude.AI over ChatGPT plus?""to both applications as well. ChatGPT answered both the questions in a relatively fair, if not somewhat impertinent, manner. Disappointingly, Claude refused to answer either question. With the sonnet 3.5 model, it generated a too-safe and intellectual disrespectful non-answer that took me aback. I am not looking for a public relations statement: I was hoping to see a side-by-side comparison rather than a defensive explanation about how Claude doesn't know anything about itself nor other language models, and it doesn't want to make detrimental statements or something to that regard. Moreover I am hurt and quite frankly insulted that I am not allowed to modify the system prompt for claude.AI. I know the same goes for ChatGPT, however, at least that application has custom GPTs.

I understand why companies such as anthropic and open AI want to be conscious about AI safety, but I feel that when it gets in the way of critical thinking and simple product comparison, the training wheels need to come off or else. These products will be nerf'd before they can be useful. 

I really enjoyed using anthropic API to access their models last three months. I believe that, Op. 3 and sonnet 3.5 are vastly superior to GPT-4o in terms of writing capability and logical reasoning. I am unfortunately dismayed that the $20 month subscription model that Claude.AI offers pales in comparison to the $20 month subscription option with ChatGPT plus. I think I found the answer to my question that I poised to both of the models, unfortunately.",2024-07-01 16:10:48,2

"I have an iPhone 12 mini in battery saver (>30% battery), latest iOS. 

Claude begins to reply. I scroll up to review past output. It feels like I am “fighting upstream” to scroll at est. 1-8 FPS”. 

Jerky, laggy, unusable until Claude’s reply is finished. 

Similar effect without power saver, but perhaps 20-23FPS or so as it feels “cinematic.” 

My apologies for leaving this as a review: however the “App Support” button in App Store takes me to a FAQ site and I was unable to find a way to submit a bug report. Please let me know if you need a video of this issue taken with another device. 

Do you need me to offer more of a “hands-on” experience for you? We can gladly set up a RustDesk or TeamViewer session and have my device plugged, any SDKs installed, for you to debug remotely while the occurs. So I gladly offer my time and remote access to my device(s).

Is there a way to enroll for this offer? Let me be a user that helps you help other users and to deliver to them a great experience. 

I believe in Anthronpic’s mission, product(s) and would like all users to have a modern, bug-free experience that matches the product value of the MLLLM behind the brand.",2024-06-15 20:50:25,1
