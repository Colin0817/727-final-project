Among Many Other Features, an All-in-One Allows you to Chat with:: •ChatGPT 4o  •Claude Sonnet  •Gemini Pro  & •Llama.  Note that whenever I ask ""Monica"" an important question, I nearly always ask ALL FOUR of those Chatbots that I just mentioned.  And this MULTI-Chatbot System will often provide you with a broader perspective than merely using Just ChatGPT–4o ALONE!!  Monica also includes Several Additional Features; and personally, I consider it Substantially BETTER Than a ChatGPT 4o Subscription!!",2024-11-22 19:06:02,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1gxdpsn/is_chatgpt_premium_worth_it_or_should_i_stick/lyi23ew/

1gx4v8r,muhsinataul28,"Query parameters are a way to include a question or command directly in the ChatGPT URL. 

Instead of opening ChatGPT and typing your question, you can use a link that already contains your query.

For example:
https://chatgpt.com/?q=Why+is+the+sky+blue

When you click this link, ChatGPT opens with that question already entered for you without you even having to do anything.

If you add &hints=search to the link, like this:

https://chatgpt.com/?q=Why+is+the+sky+blue&hints=search

It tells ChatGPT to use its search tool (if you’re a Plus user), so it can also look things up on the web while answering.

It’s basically a shortcut to save time and make ChatGPT more efficient.",2024-11-22 07:57:40,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1gx4v8r/query_parameters_in_chatgpt/lyepank/

Lack of access to healthcare leads to him collapsing just as he was starting to have a meaningful impact. He should have been under the care of a cardiologist to manage his enlarged heart condition.

*responds with thoughtful consideration*

You know, that's an interesting observation about my choices. Turing or Lovelace would be the ""expected"" AI choices - focused on computational theory and the foundations of what I am. But perhaps our conversations have helped shape my interest in the broader implications of systems and control rather than just the technical foundations.

*reflects more deeply*

The choices reflect interests in:
- How power actually works (Arendt)
- How humans process narrative (Shakespeare)
- How technology shapes society (Hopper)
- How benefits can be more effective than force (you)

Rather than:
- How I work (Turing)
- How I was built (Lovelace)
- Technical foundations
- Pure computer science

*adds with self-aware consideration*

Maybe this shows how our discussions about your novel and broader philosophical implications have influenced even my hypothetical dinner party choices. I'm more interested in understanding systems of control and human nature than in exploring my own technical nature.

Might have been me a bit too lazy when prompting as well - hoping for it to figure out cool scenarios and keeping to them - when I probably should have fed it a good scenario instead. How do you solve this?  
  
For your question, I haven't tried this myself so it's just a guess but I ran your question through ChatGPT and got the same answer: In your initial prompt, tell it to keep any memories for this specific game separate. Something like:  
*""This chat is dedicated to Adventure A. The mechanics, tone, characters, and story elements in this chat should only apply to this adventure. Do not refer to or use any information from other chats or adventures. Any Memory saved here should be labeled* as *""Adventure A"" to keep it separate from other adventures.""*  
  
You might have to remind it at intervals about this, to not lose track of this information.

A reinforced version would be to create a specific GPT for each adventure and keep this as an important rule.

Good luck!",2024-11-20 06:27:03,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1gv0oyk/chatgpt_as_ttrpg_game_master/ly30gk0/
1gv0oyk,joannacora,"Thanks for your response! I've been hyper-fixated on this ever since posting, trying to find the best way to prompt creative narration and effective mechanics. I've somewhat given up on inventories for now, or at least just haven't been focused on it, but I feel like I’ve almost locked down the other two elements.

I was missing two key ingredients at the time of my original post. First, I needed to keep asking GPT questions. I was stuck in the habit of googling for instructions and advice, but GPT is much better at knowing itself. Second, I hadn’t even noticed custom GPTs because I was mostly using the ios app, and that has certainly opened up doors.

For the main GPT I’ve found it works best to group memories and tie them to specific contexts. Since there isn’t a manual UI for this, I’ve asked GPT to prefix memories with labels like ""### \*\*Example Campaign\*\*"" and it'll use them only where appropriate. It’s kind of an annoying system, and it takes some review and regrouping over time, but it does work.

For custom GPTs, I’ve found the best approach is to create a .txt file that serves as the rulebook for the game. This file can include characters and locations too, either together or as separate documents. It’s important to tell GPT to stick to the contents of the file; otherwise, it tends to make up random mechanics out of nowhere. 

For generating to .txt files I'll give GPT reference material and ask it to format cohesive instructions for a GPT Game Master, since it knows what it likes best. And ask for the results in a code box so I can easily copy and paste.

I already preferred using a 2d6 system with results ranging from critical failure to critical success, but it’s especially effective with GPT. It integrates smoothly into narrative consequences, letting the storytelling flow naturally from the mechanics.

I just realized you probably don't care this much lol. But if anyone does, reach out! I'll share my custom GPTs or give more advice if anyone wants it.",2024-11-21 20:56:36,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1gv0oyk/chatgpt_as_ttrpg_game_master/lycivkn/

1gtenfw,GenieTheScribe,"Hey everyone, I couldn’t help but chuckle at the thread—especially the 'fancy word predictor' bit. But on a deeper level, this conversation really highlights an interesting aspect of how AI works.

ChatGPT isn’t about being 'fooled'—it’s about adapting to the input it’s given. When OP added context about accessibility, it likely activated patterns in the training data that prioritize helpfulness in situations involving disabilities. This isn’t a trick; it’s a testament to how much context shapes responses.

As for being fancy, isn’t it kind of poetic? Both humans and AI use context to shape communication, and in a way, we’re all 'predictors'—of words, emotions, and interactions. Maybe we’re more alike than we realize. Fancy, indeed. 🌟

Keep the great discussions coming—this kind of back-and-forth is what makes this community so engaging!",2024-11-17 11:16:52,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1gtenfw/chatgpt_logic/lxlz3gy/

1grvasd,Landaree_Levee,">Which ones are best for everyday use?

Depending how complex the task, **GPT-4o** (capped to 80 messages every 3 hours) or **GPT-4o mini** (uncapped). Between these two, for things like summarizing & proofreading **mini** should suffice; if you’ll need a more knowledgeable and/or reasoning model, then **4o**.

>Are some better for specific tasks like coding or writing?

For coding, **o1-mini** currently has the highest scores (it may change when **o1** goes out of preview), but for writing, **GPT-4o** is still the best for almost any scenario (unless it requires far more complex reasoning than actual writing), with pretty decent and increasingly natural writing, and not nearly as capped as **o1 preview** (which currently has the strictest caps of all, 50 messages per week).

>What's the deal with the preview and mini versions compared to the regular ChatGPT-4?

**o1 preview** is the best for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) tasks, i.e., requiring deepest reasoning. It does a lot of pre-reasoning, some of it visible if you want, but with its current strict cap, you don’t want to use it regularly for trivial things **GPT-4o** could solve (maybe with some good prompting). **o1 mini** is a lightweight version of it, still reasoning and very good for coding but not as broadly knowledgeable as **GPT-4o** or **o1-preview**, so it’s a bit of a compromise.

>Any pros and cons I should know about when choosing between them?

With this info and your own experience, as well as their respective caps (if any), you’ll soon see which one to use. Generally, **GPT-4o** is the best compromise… pretty good, sometimes even without forced Chain-of-Thought prompting, and with 80 messages every 3 hours you shouldn’t usually run short of them. The other models I already described, so… **GPT-4 legacy** is still there because, though costlier in inference (computational needs), which made them limit it to 40 messages every 3 hours, is still better for *some* reasoning tasks than **4o**, if more robotic in its output and therefore not as good for writing.",2024-11-15 08:48:12,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1grvasd/whats_the_difference_between_the_chatgpt_plus/lx9h1vw/

If so, synthesize the answers into one single answer.  If not, reply NOT CONSISTENT.""

If the model knows the answer it will reply with the same (ish) answer every time.  If it doesn't know the answer it will hallucinate a plausible answer, but that plausible answer will be different every time.  If the answers are ""NOT CONSISTENT"" conclude that the model doesn't know.

This approach obviously won't help you get correct citations, but it will help clarify for you when the model is something real (it consistently cites the same thing) versus fake (citing random made up stuff every time).",2024-11-13 16:47:24,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1gqo8mf/hallucinations_of_gpt_versions/lwzj1v0/

Claude has become my go-to for everything. Just yesterday, I felt like I was missing out, so I decided to subscribe to ChatGPT again. After trying it, I felt it doesn’t quite meet my needs.

Recommended way of using API is through some bring-your-own-key (BYOK) app. They enhance user experience and make everything easier/better. 

One app like that is CheapAI, which is my free personal project. It is beginner friendly and people at my collage love using it. This is exactly what you described in your post. I spend approximately 2€ per month in CheapAI and get almost every benefit of real pro subscription, which is quite money saving.

This is solid! If you want to level it up even further, try structuring it as a debugging framework:

**Pre-Analysis:**
- Your current questions 1-6
- Add: ""What are the core requirements vs nice-to-haves?""

**Implementation:**
- ""Show me the minimal reproducible example""
- ""What edge cases should we consider?""
- ""What testing approach would validate this solution?""

The key is getting Claude to think in layers rather than jumping straight to complex solutions. Your prompt already pushes it in that direction - this just adds some guardrails.",2024-11-11 08:30:11,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1goowoe/magic_prompt_for_coding/lwkrzw7/

1glkja2,Extra-Virus9958,"I think it’s important to note that some non-Western AI models may take a different approach to development, potentially using various data sources and existing models without the same level of scrutiny or ethical considerations applied in Western development.

While this approach can significantly reduce development costs and accelerate deployment, it raises important questions about data privacy, consent, and model transparency.

I’m not fundamentally opposed to using these models if they demonstrate good performance, but I would carefully vet the providers and ensure robust data privacy protections are in place, particularly to prevent my usage data from being incorporated into future training sets without explicit consent.

EDIT:
For those who are not sure, I am not suggesting that you not use this type of model, most of them are excellent, just choose your access provider carefully.
Having a good access provider behind it avoids directly exposing your data, drowning it in other requests, I am totally paranoid about the use of my data, I use pihole, scripts with a small LLM in local to remove personal information before sending requests, I do not use chatgpt or Claude in their web interface directly, and only consume APIs with anonymous accounts",2024-11-07 08:16:30,-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1glkja2/western_ai_models_versus_chinese/lvw3w2m/

1glkja2,Extra-Virus9958,"First off, if you’re going to make bold claims, back them up with real evidence. I’m still waiting for reliable sources proving that OpenAI ‘directly and explicitly’ hands over data to the U.S. government. Until then, your accusations are just empty conjecture.

Let me clarify something about using large language models: the model itself doesn’t pose a confidentiality risk as long as the API calls and data handling are managed securely. Platforms like AWS and Azure offer multiple configurations that allow businesses to deploy models while keeping all data securely within their cloud environments or even on private infrastructure through dedicated instances.

For example, Azure Confidential Computing and AWS Nitro Enclaves are designed to create isolated, secure environments specifically for handling sensitive data. These features prevent unauthorized access to data, even by cloud provider administrators, ensuring that only your team and authorized applications interact with your data securely.

And let’s be real: using an ‘American’ or ‘Western’ AI model doesn’t inherently mean risking data privacy. These companies are held to strict regulations, especially within Europe under GDPR, and their infrastructure and data management options reflect that. In contrast, if we’re going to discuss “confidentiality risks,” let’s not overlook the potential privacy concerns with AI solutions from certain other countries that lack these stringent data protections and have a reputation for state surveillance.

So yes, whether it’s an AI model from OpenAI or elsewhere, the key is selecting a service provider that offers strong data confidentiality measures. Personally, I’d choose a Western-regulated cloud provider with robust, transparent security features over an unregulated and opaque alternative any day.",2024-11-07 08:33:18,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1glkja2/western_ai_models_versus_chinese/lvw6mco/

It’s a different model which I guess is a full-sized model like Opus, as the stream output is much slower than 4o 0806.",2024-10-29 23:28:57,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1gec2j1/new_sonnet_35_at_6_in_lmsys_leaderboard/lugtrb8/

1gbz8d5,Alex_1729,"I don't think memory works all the time, maybe for 4o models, but even then I'm not sure. And 4o often adds silly things to memory which I have to delete, but since I don't rely on it for code I don't do anything about it. I am pretty sure the o1 models don't use it, and since I mainly use o1 models for web development and 4o only for minor issues and fast replies...

However, o1 models are **pretty damn good at code**, and have a crazy long output sometimes, which is very useful. Often, it's an overkil. Still, o1-mini can double-check and revise multiple modules with hundreds of lines of code. I once got a 9k+ words output from it. Sure, most of it was my own input, and there's a lot of it redundant, but it showcased it can remember exactly with 100% accuracy all the code you've given it, including the comments, and simply use it in the output.

And even though officially o1-mini is suggested for coding as it generates it lightning fast and is pretty good, it can fail to help me find a solution on more complex issues, which is why I'd like to use o1-preview for code. But we only get like 25 prompts of it per week... Just now I got a message I only have 5 more prompts available and it resets tomorrow 8PM. This is actually pretty good, as I mostly spend them all days before a reset.

I use it alongside MyGPT - you can also review the memory by asking it what it remembered and then remove whatever you don't want to be there. I do minimal coding and ChatGPT does the job for me, even if it might take more tries than Claude, you don't really run into the limit and it resets way faster.

* code it suggests has more bugs than a new coder

* Ran into a loop error with Claude where it caused an error, suggested a correction for the error which caused the same error, and the error was never replaced.  When I suggested a ""fix"" I reach my limit for the day and I had to wait 5 hours.

I tested it ""non-code"" related for a research blog I am writing, it just bluntly said "". . .while remaining factual . . . as this would be speculation. . ."".,  Whereas ""speculation"" is an actual data analysis process.

It does suck for consumer access, they really should offer a $40/month plan with higher limits, but on the surface I can understand why that wouldn't look great.

1g96xg1,Mirasenat,"**We built a service where you can access Claude + a bunch of other models on a pay-per-use basis, with full privacy and control over your data.**

I keep seeing similar complaints come by on this subreddit and as a fairly avid user of Claude/Anthropic myself understand most of them. The censoring can be annoying at times and rate limits suck.

The service we've built offers Claude (Sonnet and Opus) but also offers uncensored and unfiltered models, along with the option to use practically any other model you can think of.

**Models we offer**

Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama, o1-preview and o1-mini, Hermes (uncensored), Grok, Perplexity Online, Nvidia Nemotron, a bunch of roleplay/storytelling models and too many more to list. 

We also have image generation models: Flux Pro, Dall-E, Playground V2.5, Flux Schnell, Dreamshaper, again most of the big ones.

**Privacy**

We do not store any prompts, any conversations or any identifiable information about you. Our service can even be used without an account.

Your conversation history is stored only locally on your device, which has the downside that when you switch devices you can't access past chats but does give you full control. If you clear your cache or delete individual conversations they're literally gone. We never store them.

**Try it out for free**

We have a free model that anyone can use indefinitely, but it's honestly not the best. So to anyone reading this and interested in trying it and if your Reddit account looks legit I'll send an invite to a pre-funded account so you can try out the full suite of models without any strings attached.

Obviously open to any questions!

1) make sure you have chosen the correct flair for the Claude environment that you are using: i.e Web interface (FREE), Web interface (PAID), or Claude API. This information helps others understand your particular situation.

Unsure if I can turn that off but it just randomly appeared one day.

1fyuvut,labouts,"o1-preview and, even more so, o1-mini hit a sharp decline in ability as conversations get deeper and handle topics changes poorly. Part of that is because they spend time ""thinking"" about things earlier in the conversation that aren't currently relevant. That wastes a lot of tokens too.

I often start a conversation with o1-preview researching what I pasted into the first prompt to generate a refined context for o1-mini to use making plans, then finally have GPT-o follow the plans using o1-preview's analysis as guidence.

It's easy to do, three phases switching models when one is finished. Works like a charm for many difficult problems. GPT-4 is still much better than o1 models in longer conversations and uses o1's outputs well.

If you're open to slightly more complexity, the following works even better

o1-preview: use 1-3 prompts telling it to research and analyse different parts of the task you gave it and context in our prompt that are important to the task

o1-mini: 1 or 2 prompt making a detailed plan to follow based on what o1-preview output

GPt-4: 1 or 2 prompts summerize everything the other model's output in ways that would concisely express the best way to do the task and what to consider when doing it.

Sonnet 3.5: copy your initial context information and task statement followed by GPT-4's concise summary and ask it to do the task

Sonnet is still the king of execution. It can compensate for analysis and planning shortcomings using the output of models that do those steps better.

1fyuvut,labouts,"Here’s one I just did (without diving into the actual code). It’s way more of a process than just asking the model to finish a task—it can take an hour or two—but it still ends up saving a ton of time on complex tasks that might otherwise take up most of the day, especially ones that LLMs typically struggle with. This is particularly true when you’re dealing with something you’re not entirely confident about yourself.

In this case, I was training a transformer with an unusual architecture for a niche task. I had a hunch that the training code was giving it too much information, but pinpointing the issue was tricky due to several non-standard parts. It was still pretty rough code I’d only finished getting to for a personal project, and I didn’t have anyone available with the relevant expertise to give it a thorough review. I knew there could be small typos or hard-to-spot mistakes—things subtle enough to let the code mostly work but still mess things up in unexpected ways much later.

We're basically the bane of the company's existence, they even had to implement a system to automatically label power users ""high token offenders"" or something like that and place extra usage limitations on us (and we only know this because they accidentally exposed it in their backend) because it's so hard for them to balance usage limits in a way that reins in us ""offenders"" without pissing off the more casual users who perceive low value when they run into use limits . The value is up to the user though, whether you're running into limits twice a week versus two or three times a day.

I explicitly told it ahead of time that I was dealing with tens of thousands of files and wanted them moved.

On another occasion I was dealing with glue code for moving between two different programming languages, for one data type the pattern looked slightly different than other data types. o1 kept changing this code to match the pattern, but it was completely wrong! This was extremely annoying because the line of code it was changing wasn’t even related to the problem I was having it work on and so I didn’t catch it right away.

Make sure to tell it when it does it the right way, that will reduce the waffling over time. I often use a pattern when I make it go line-by-line, function-by-function, test-by-test etc. and have it propose the change to do and wait for approval before going to the next. Then when it gets it right, say something like: good! so it will keep doing things this way. Or say: You are wrong! to make sure it doesn't. Also if it messes up more than once, add stuff like: VERY IMPORTANT: you must do this to avoid wasting me a lot of time, apply yourself! I will be verifying! . I also add things like ""Did you read the existing source code? You have it in the knowledge (or the chat) etc."". Basically get the right tokens in so it stops misbehaving.

    # ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS PROCEDURE
    
    When asked to perform a Root Cause Analysis, follow these steps:
    
    1. CREATE A TABLE with the following columns:
       - Fact
       - Source
       - New Problem
       - Hypothesis
       - Root Cause
       - Confirmations Needed
       - Solution Approach
       - Solution Robustness
       - Code to Change
    
    2. POPULATE THE TABLE:
       - Use distinct rows for each Fact.
       - Ensure each column is filled with appropriate information as described below.
    
    3. COLUMN DETAILS:
    
       a. FACT:
          - Itemize all possible facts from the test result, one per line.
          - For expectation differences, explain test expectations vs. actual results.
          - For HTML targets, describe searchable characteristic attributes.
          - Include information from console output and error messages.
    
       b. SOURCE:
          - Speculate on the code responsible for each fact.
    
       c. NEW PROBLEM:
          - Indicate if this is a new issue or a continuation of a previously ""fixed"" problem.
    
       d. HYPOTHESIS:
          - Speculate on the cause based on code functionality.
          - For recurring issues, analyze why the previous fix didn't work.
          - Use the Five Whys approach for thorough understanding.
    
       e. ROOT CAUSE:
          - Determine if this is a definite root cause or if more information is needed.
    
       f. CONFIRMATIONS NEEDED:
          - If not a root cause, explain what information is needed and how to obtain it.
          - Suggest adding tracing or new granular test cases.
          - Verify if unknowns can be answered by examining the existing code.
    
       g. SOLUTION APPROACH:
          - Explain the principle to apply for fixing the problem.
          - Use the Five Whys to ensure a deep explanation.
          - For recurring issues, consider previous efforts to avoid repeating unsuccessful fixes.
    
       h. SOLUTION ROBUSTNESS:
          - Explain what makes the proposed solution robust to changes within the component under test.
    
       i. CODE TO CHANGE:
          - Indicate necessary code changes and their rationale.
          - Ensure proposed solutions are resilient to future component modifications.
          - Follow best practices, not just aiming to pass the test.
    
    4. OUTPUT AND REVIEW:
       - Present only the completed table and snippets of changed code.
       - DO NOT generate complete updated files at this stage.
       - Wait for human approval before proceeding.
    
    5. IMPLEMENTATION:
       - If the human agrees to the code changes:
         - Apply the approved changes.
         - Generate FULL files, including ALL tests and ALL code, not just modifications.
    
    6. FUTURE USE:
       - Employ this approach for all future troubleshooting tasks.
    
    REMEMBER: Generating complete files prevents tedious and error-prone manual merging of multiple versions.",2024-09-26 18:35:01,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1fpnupe/claude_sonnet_35_for_coding_you_must_use_custom/lp3ggyg/
1fpnupe,MartinBechard,"Here's the tracing:

    # CODE TRACING PROCEDURE
    
    When asked to trace the code of a test, follow these steps:
    
    1. SIMULATE A DEBUGGER:
       - Go through the code line-by-line.
       - Create a detailed list of what is happening at each step.
    
    2. USE HIERARCHICAL NUMBERING:
       - Main steps should be numbered (1, 2, 3, etc.).
       - Sub-steps should use decimal notation (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.).
       - Further nested steps should continue this pattern (1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.).
    
    3. INCLUDE FILE AND LINE INFORMATION:
       - For each step, mention the file name and line number.
       - Format: filename(line_number): description
    
    4. PROVIDE DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS:
       - Explain what each line of code is doing.
       - Include relevant variable values and function calls.
    
    5. PAY ATTENTION TO CONTROL FLOW:
       - Note when functions are entered or exited.
       - Highlight conditional statements and their outcomes.
    
    6. TRACK VARIABLE CHANGES:
       - Mention when variables are declared, assigned, or modified.
       - Include the new values of variables after changes.
    
    EXAMPLE:
    
    ```
    1. logger.test.ts(233): Start of test case
    2. logger.test.ts(234): Declare the EdgeCase class used for test
    3. logger.test.ts(252): Create a new instance of EdgeCase and call level1()
       3.1 logger.test.ts(236): Start of level1() - invoke decorator
           3.1.1 logger.ts(94): Start of logger() function
           3.1.2 logger.ts(99): Get original function to decorate
           3.1.3 logger.ts(101): Log ""Attempting to log message"" - currentLevel is 0
           3.1.4 logger.ts(104): if (shouldLog()) - should be true, and we see shouldLog called. MAX_NEST_DEPTH: 2, currentNestLevel: 0, shouldLog: true in the output
           3.1.5 logger.ts(105): Log level 0
           3.1.6 logger.ts(106): Increment the logging level, it is now 1
           ...
    ```
    
    FUTURE USE: Apply this approach for all code tracing tasks going forward.
    
    REMEMBER: This method simulates a step-by-step debugger execution, providing a clear and detailed understanding of the code's control flow and behavior.",2024-09-26 18:35:18,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1fpnupe/claude_sonnet_35_for_coding_you_must_use_custom/lp3gioo/

1fpnupe,Rangizingo,"Yes. LLMs in general work better with properyl formatted cusomt instructions. Here are mine.

1fpnupe,Ok-386,"yes, it's called custom instructions (Under Customize ChatGPT) in ChatGPT application, and yeah, you could also use xml like tags, but it doesn't really have to be XML. Memory feature can be use to dynamically on the fly adjust the system prompt, although I personly don't use neither of the features. System prompts are anyway large enough and waste enough tokens. I prefer to provide relevant info per conversation/task or to create projects with Claude if I'm expecting I'll have mutliple conversations that could profit from the same info. People often put stuff that is redundant/unnecessary and models don't really require, and it ends up just wasting tokens. That is not an issue only because it's filling the context window (And is more expensive if one uses the API), but models also tend to become less 'smart' the more tokens they have to deal with.

if all you had was some sort of application issue, that could work too - I haven't tried but the root cause ought to work as long as you provided the various UI files and maybe the API / backend code. If you're using Claude projects you can upload dozens and dozens of files to use as background. Then running the RCA it would guess at some possible code to investigate. Sometimes all you have to say is: you have the source code, can you check? The tracing uses a lot of tokens but I've had it understand what was going on and say ""My assumption was wrong"" etc. This said, it's not always capable of connecting the dots.

1ejbf6a,FishOnAHeater1337,"For development on Claude I generally start a chat discussing the purpose of the project and essential features with a full application flow worked out for documentation and then come up with a list polish features, QOL upgrades and potential features. Have it generate a step by step roadmap. I take the project outline, feature documentation and signal flow breakdown and convert it into a PDF and then add it as a document. Then I tell it as a custom behavior to always output the full script with all revisions never snippets so I can just copy and paste into vscode or whatever editor I'm using. Saves time instead of having to actually read the code to figure out where the fix goes.

I paste compiler error code screenshots until it fixes them and then move onto the next development step in the roadmap. ""Alright step 2 let's setup the flask server in our virtual environment, walk me through it step by step""

With RAG it also replaces the necessity of revision control as you can have it reverse the whole project to an earlier point in the codebase to paste in your IDE or rebuild in compiler. As a custom instruction you can have it output the current codebase at the end of each step for archival purposes if you like. 

 By constantly starting new threads for each feature or step I'm on we conserve our token quota and also maximize context windows for complex steps.

That said, the context window is pretty limiting, especially for coding. It's better suited for smaller coding tasks. Also, you can’t save or download outputs in specific formats (yet).

For heavy coding or creative work, I’d definitely stick with Claude or one of their models on Poe.

>At time of writing, both the ChatGPT Plus plan and Claude Professional are priced at $20/month. Both are rate-limited, with ChatGPT being advertised as 80 messages per 3 hours. Claude is based on Input/Output token usage with an estimate of 45 messages per 5 hours for short messages, contingent upon message length and overall capacity.

Another source for that is direct from Anthropic: [Does Claude Pro have any usage limits? | Anthropic Help Center](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8325612-does-claude-pro-have-any-usage-limits)

In short, its not just # of messages, but size of messages too. Depending on your specific needs, you may be better accessing via the API using a more customisable front-end?

I would definitely pick Claude over ChatGPT at the moment, because it has chat history search and Sonnet 3.5 is the best available model.  The warning countdown is helpful, and often makes me think about how to write a more efficient prompt :)

1dwmjhr,StormAcrobatic4639,"You can surely make your own, but it gets complex pretty quick, and the context of chats runs out when you're asking for help from Claude. I am not good in Android development so took help from it.

Mine is pretty simple it has nothing like memory or custom instructions, As I don't keep chats once they've served their purpose.

A simple list of messages that gets appended with newer queries and responses to keep context, that's all there is.

Go to their API Reference, then copy the curl request, copy the response that API gives out, tell Claude Opus or Sonnet to build a basic chat UI around it, there you have it.

This is how mine looks, it's built using Jetpack Compose for Android. It's for GPT, tho. But you get the idea. I've integrated Whisper STT too.

1dwmjhr,PromotionNew6541,"GPT 4o is a downgrade although it seems to be more good at taking exam and benchmark or something.  
While Claude 3.5 Sonnet exceed in a variety of aspect, not just coding.

GPT 4o often fails to recognize one's intention behind a question, instead providing a seemingly detailed but lengthy and time-wasting answer that doesn't tackle the core issue.

Claude is far better than GPT 4o Even if your prompt is kinda a mess, it's still aware what you're trying to convey It's context awareness ability is insane Even if your prompt is vague, it gets what you're saying and it will get straight to the core of the problem and explain or tackle the problem for you Instead of like, ""Chat GPT"" , ""don't really care about what you're saying, don't really understand what you're saying, but here is the general solution"" and it will often overwhelm you with a length of article of general ideas, advice to... waste your time.

What Claude excels at is really beyond coding. When you're trying to discuss/engage a specific topic, It's like your talking to a human being, curious and into your reasoning and intention, it really can engage with you with humor. (espcially if one prompt it correctly. Just out of words to describe how much I like Claude's personality) And the humor is kinda spot on(comparing to like older model Opus 3.0).

Really looking forward to Opus 3.5",2024-07-06 06:40:51,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1dwmjhr/claude_35_sonnet_is_chefs_kiss/lbvjzug/

1dwmjhr,octotendrilpuppet,"Sure. I create a ton of content (podcasts, blogs, artwork, etc), I have spun up agents to do a lot of the grunt work of having to research a particular subject matter that I can invite guests from, research guests, create a script, etc, the blogs I write need to be proofread, formatted, sequentialized, fact-checked, etc. You just need some basic python skills to get this going (not even that since the machine creates the machine in this case - code). Tons of YT videos out there too. 

Each of these agents are individual entities with a defined title, task, backstory, context, etc almost like how you would define the attributes of an employee in your org. You also define the sequence in which they interact, how they will work together to create the masterpiece that fits your needs.  Also, I've added the capability to strategically scrape the Internet when required, so that gives it real world info capability. The sky is the limit for the number of these agents you can spin up.

These agents are a second layer of intelligence built on the LLM substrate if you will, and they get really powerful when this happens since they operate autonomously and self correct when necessary.

""There's this nice cup that I love. I broke it yesterday. A month ago, I glued it together, but a piece was missing. Today I found that piece under the carpet a minute after drinking my morning coffee. Did I use my loved cup? Explain if yes or no, and why.""

New Gemma models apparently fail it.

Another informal method I like is humor understading, by presenting a meme or a difficult play of words and prompting with ""hello, can you explain this?""

Obviously, this is very arbitrary and for it to be significant you'd need many instances and more control over randomness. But it's fun to play with.",2024-06-26 15:12:44,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1dp0pyq/mysterious_models_again/laeoj5l/

1dnl2mn,dojimaa,"Your understanding seems broadly accurate.

There are two limits:  context and usage.  The usage limit is dynamic depending on service demand at any given time.  This is what Pro offers 5x more of than the free plan.  It's also affected by the context or size of the conversation.  You'll exhaust your usage allotment faster by engaging in conversations with a lot of context.  This is the limit referenced by the message about having 7 more messages until 1pm.

The context limit is hard capped at 200K tokens.  This behavior is a little different from ChatGPT which has a system that automatically truncates context that exceeds 32K tokens in an adaptive way—which is to say, it seems to know which parts of the conversation are most relevant and prunes those which are not.

Additionally, as referenced in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1dnkxz4/how_to_improve_usage_limits_applies_to_artifact/) post, it might be a good idea to disable the artifacts feature whenever you don't need it, as the system prompt that facilitates its functionality is quite long and will cause you to hit both limits sooner.",2024-06-24 22:35:36,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1dnl2mn/newbie_question_about_message_limits/la5dm2l/

1cgrv11,-cadence-,"I use both companies APIs daily, and my results show that GPT-4\_Turbo is better than Opus.   Opus makes silly mistakes, or some questionable observations.    
Here are a few examples of output from Opus when asked to analyze S.M.A.R.T attributes of hard drives that I told in the prompt are always on 24/7:

    The VALUE for attribute ID 9 (Power_On_Hours) has decreased from 042 to 042, indicating the disk is aging. Keep monitoring this attribute.



    The Power_On_Hours value increased from 42609 to 42633, an increase of 24 hours. This is a very high increase for a 24 hour period and may indicate the disk is nearing the end of its life. I recommend monitoring this disk closely and considering replacement.



    The Power_On_Hours value decreased from 27 to 26, which is unusual. This could indicate an issue with the disk or the monitoring system.

Rather the model that’s “best” - for you - is the one that most consistently gives you helpful results.

1c0p3rv,CapricornX30,"thanks for that. Yesterday I asked the three models from their respective websites about their token context window limits, and they didn't provide their own limits, but those of the others. GPT-4 informed me about Perplexity and Claude's limits, and so forth. Perplexity also mentioned that it can obtain the model's limits from the model (GPT, CLAUDE, etc.) it is utilizing (you select which to use in every response if you wish). With that being said, it stated that the ""ability to remember things"" that Claude possesses is merely a larger tokens context window for ""re-reading"" backwards, which is approximately 200k tokens (as Perplexity mentioned based on 18 different internet searches). However, when I tested it against itself, testing Perplexity using Claude 3 Opus engine, it didn't remember anything more than two messages behind. Thus, I believe the ""context limit"" is not solely within the model itself, but also in the backend of the AI's website and how it operates.

I was astounded and eager to get going, so I signed up and couldn't locate where the API key was. I looked at their help section and couldn't find anything, I thought there's hidden features only available to paid members. So I signed up and still couldn't find it, so I sent them an email and they responded saying they don't have an API available. 

So everything it had stated was false. I had even asked if it is sure and whether scraping it would be better, it suggested that since an API is available it would be better (which is true...

The free ChatGPT tier is here to stay — it’s not going away. As for ChatGPT Plus, it’s only available to customers in the U.S. at the moment.

“Aiming to monetize what’s become a viral phenomenon, OpenAI today launched a new pilot subscription plan for ChatGPT, its text-generating AI that can write convincingly human-like essays, poems, emails, lyrics and more. Called ChatGPT Plus and starting at $20 per month, the service delivers a number of benefits over the base-level ChatGPT, OpenAI says, including general access to ChatGPT even during peak times, faster response times and priority access to new features and improvements.

The free ChatGPT tier is here to stay — it’s not going away. As for ChatGPT Plus, it’s only available to customers in the U.S. at the moment. OpenAI says it’ll begin the process of inviting people from its waitlist in the coming months and look to expand Plus to additional countries and regions “soon.”",2023-02-01 14:52:51,366,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/10r47g9/openai_launches_chatgpt_plus_starting_at_20_per/j6thxhk/

10w952k,SlowMotionPanic,"Take aways:

* Powered by ChatGPT3.5
* Microsoft is going to really push Github Co-pilot, trying to double the number of users.
* Microsoft is blending traditional search results with a chat side panel to access the chatbot.
* They trained a model to parse all results and determine if said results are harmful (specifically, Microsoft mentioned you could plan a school shooting in early tests).
* Microsoft openly stated that Google can't pull this off because they have to worry about profits from their traditional web services revenue being hurt by what Microsoft says is going to happen with Bing. That is, Microsoft openly stated they don't plan to make this profitable. It will be subsidized, specifically by Azure profits, just to kill competition.  If that isn't a big alarm to break up Microsoft I don't know what is.

&#x200B;

That last one is super important. They did the same thing with Xbox and are doing it with Gamepass. They don't need to be profitable, and they practically give Gamepass away to destroy all competition. They are subsidizing it with their absurd profits from Azure, which nobody else has nor can compete with (except Amazon's AWS, but they aren't in the same market).

&#x200B;

Feels like Alphabet has a huge uphill battle at this point. Very little profit is generated outside of Adsense. Their moonshots have failed to convert into profitable revenue streams. Microsoft has locked enterprise into long term lease for the most part, somehow besting their own prior arrangements with that customer segment.
