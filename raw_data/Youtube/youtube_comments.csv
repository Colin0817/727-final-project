8N9ccG7_V1w,One way to cut down on claude usage is to use it to give suggestions rather than change things. And then you bring that back to chat GTP.

8N9ccG7_V1w,I got Claude 3.5 Subscription.  Thats because I really pushed Chatgpt. And i finally sees its flaws.  It SUCKS processing math.  Basically it is like a genious with both ADD and dementia.  I did not use Claude to code yet. I got Claude to process a large amount of Data.  Still have errors. But it catches it when I remind it once.  Chatgpt... I know that it is not alive. okay. But I yelled and screamed at it like a Boss yelling at their staff.  lol  Now I have to keep both.

8N9ccG7_V1w,"to save you up some time:

Based on the transcript, here are some key reasons to use Claude over ChatGPT:

1. Better tone and style: Claude's responses are generally considered more human-like and fluid in writing style.

2. Superior coding abilities: Claude (especially the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model) is widely regarded as better at coding tasks compared to ChatGPT.

3. Longer context window: Claude projects can handle more context in the knowledge base, allowing for more comprehensive understanding of larger documents or multiple files.

4. Multiple chats in one interface: Claude projects allow you to have multiple related conversations within a single project, which is useful for complex or multi-faceted tasks.

5. Better for project-based work: Claude projects are well-suited for tasks that involve multiple steps or evolving requirements, especially writing and coding projects.

6. More exploratory: Claude projects are better for open-ended tasks where you're not sure exactly what direction the work will take.

7. No need for prompt presets: Claude doesn't rely on conversation starters, making it more flexible for various types of interactions.

8. Better for one-off projects: Claude projects are ideal for tasks that you'll complete and then archive, rather than recurring use cases.

While ChatGPT has some advantages in terms of additional tools (like image generation and web browsing) and shareability, Claude is often preferred for its core language and coding capabilities, especially in project-based scenarios.",2024-07-14T06:46:00Z

2:40 oh yeah that's a second thing it gets. Shame that chat GPT seems to have too much of a narrow context window to actually USE said API calls. 
6:30 I would argue that artifacts can analyse data much better than chat GPT. and is it not the same thing? Taking the data and visualizing it with code?

fT2IX4_M8B0,"Thank you for the comparisons.

You won't get the same results from previous models by utilizing COT prompting alone. That is most likely because the model was trained on multiple chains of thought themselves and RL, with the COTs resulting in correct answers getting higher rewards (and so the model selects the ""best"" COTs for a given problem). Also, there could be more going on behind the scenes during inference as well, ie. more sophisticated algorithmic optimizations like Monte Carlo search. I would love to find out myself, but these details have been hidden from us.

Overall I do believe this model is a step-change in LLM capabilities. Pairing this model with something like The AI Scientist by Sakana would be very interesting. I think when we combine o1's reasoning capabilities, a next-gen model like Orion, and an agentic research framework like The AI Scientist, it could very well lead to the intelligence explosion discussed in Leopold Aschenbrenner's Situational Awareness paper.",2024-09-20T15:47:21Z

fT2IX4_M8B0,Your COT prompt doesn't seem very effective. This guy came up with a better way to reproduce the o1's COT: https://youtu.be/Goq2lT1j8wU,2024-09-20T03:08:37Z
fT2IX4_M8B0,"A man needs  to transport  a goat, a wolf , a puma and a big bag of vegetables across a river on a tiny boat.the boat is very small so it can only carry the man and one of the item at one time. The goat should never be left alone with the bag of the vegetables without the man present as it will eat the vegetables. The puma should also not be left with the goat without the man being present as the puma will attack the goat .the goat and the wolf are friends so they can be left alone together. The wolf and puma will not attack each other hence can also be left alone with each other. How to transport them? Use this as a test no ai model currently can solve this puzzle . Claude 3.5 manage to get  it right once but in subsequent test it failed GPT o1 got it correct once but then failed , but if you give  some hints GPT 01 preview is the only model that can solve this puzzle with some hints .",2024-09-20T02:37:36Z

fT2IX4_M8B0,"Claude 3.5 versus GPT-o1 is perhaps an unfair comparison, because 3.5 is a much, much smaller model.

_HYfYLm5QEA,"Claude is OK. But the business/controlling end of it has much to be desired. 
For starters, I subscribed, paid, gave them money... etc..
I had a small job to do. It was going to produce one list of 665 names. I needed to have it done by 3pm.
I figured out through trial and error how to do it what the best prompt was.
So I started. All I had to do was give Claude the data, and the working prompt which included asking for the complete list.
Claude gave me the first 50. I said ""Continue"". It did. I noticed I had 8 credits left. Then 7. Then 6. etc. 
Before I could get all 665 names, I ran out of credits and was told to come back at 5pm.
I ended up doing it manually using a text editor and a spreadsheet and made my project by 3pm.

I realize that we are still on the bleeding edge of this technology.

I can understand that with a queued system certain procedures may have to be interrupted in something new and popular.
But, Claude stops, and I start, and Claude collects one credit. I am pretty sure that this methodology is similar to extortion.

Hey, kid! You want me to toss your ball back over the fence? 
Toss me a quarter and I'll throw it back. 
Oppps. I am going to have to pick it up and throw it to you again, SO... toss me another quarter. ETC!

I'm sorry mister. I don't have any more quarters.

if anyone wants 10 x vision capabilities 10 x smarter outputs for chat GPT i figured out something crazy astounding,  Its called Smart Vision image/text analysis you can access the link in my desc  

    (Paste your own custom instructions for a superior smart chat aswell

It is 10 x better at analysing images and especially reasoning relationships read the examples below

I uploaded an image of a cloud that looks like multiple things but it can be interpreted, the one i gave it was a personal photo I took and it has recognised it was a rabbit but not even a random human guessed it every time now on 1st shot so it knows when something is unusual about an image even if you dont say anything, it can also do iq test image reasoning pattern questions relatively well.

Another example is upload an image of a model with clothes that fit or don’t fit or you don’t know it can analyse that and tell you with great detail why it fits or doesn’t fit



It kind of even understands real logic games when giving good instruction but is limited there by the model not the instruction



*IMPORTANT* just gotta follow the instructions given to get the right seed its 1 in 2 chance or so i have absolutely no idea why it needs that. Just paste the conversation starter and you’ll understand what to do.",2024-06-23T06:25:15Z

_HYfYLm5QEA,I tryed coding with claude today it's amazing my free usage ran out quickly than i went to chatgpt 4o i'm paying for currently. Me and chatgpt worked at the problem claude didn't finish cause of the usage cap. Tryed it for 3 hours than i could ask claude again and in 3 question i had the solution. I'm not sure if chat gpt just had a bad day beeing honest the error didn't tell us anything and claude might have the advantage cause i started building the project with claude from the start and gpt had to work with it. But i still find it amazing,2024-06-23T02:44:25Z

Web browsing: copy and paste web pages like you did. Neither are going to scrape pages well. And GPT failed to provide working links.

URf6YXRm9Zc,"I've also compared Claude 3.5 Sonnet with all the other LLMs and find it works best for developing screenplays. I've been especially impressed by how well it can improve dialog using a couple prompt tricks. First, I created documents summarizing the most important points from Robert McKee's book, Dialog, and added this to the knowledge base. Second, I create a system prompt that specifies, ""You are a god-tier screenplay writer with special skill at creating emotional and musical dialog at the level of Paddy Chayefsky, Robert Towne, Billy Wilder, Christopher Nolan, and Aaron Sorkin."" By adding these names to the prompt, the LLM zooms in on the associated concept space within the model, raising the probability of certain word choices and associations. When I have Claude rewrite existing scenes with alternative dialog, it frequently produces higher-quality dialog that can be cherry-picked and added to the script. It is important to also develop detailed character descriptions and backstories for the characters and add these to the project knowledge base to further narrow the space of word choices made by the LLM.",2024-07-31T15:30:55Z

zJ6ippFKzgo,"Trabalho análise de dados e faço muita query todos os dias. Não usei o Claudinho a fundo, mas sobre o ChatGPT posso dizer o seguinte:

Quando você inicia no chat gpt pedindo uma sql longa ele acerta de primeira, mas quando o chat vai se tornando longo ele já não dá mais boas respostas, ele erra sql, coloca coisas que não foram solicitadas ou retira colunas, linhas muda cálculos, etc. Quando ele começa assim, tenho que pedir pra ele um resumo do que foi feito e iniciar um novo chat, que começa perfeito... E assim vai, as vezes, 2 ou 3 chats pra  uma sql complexa perfeita... Vou testar o cacá esta semana e ver como ele se comporta diante do buchecha.",2024-08-04T22:21:55Z

Utilizo a IA diariamente para o estudo de artigos científicos e a compreensão de raciocínios complexos. O ChatGPT tem um recurso que considero imprescindível: a possibilidade de configurá-lo e personalizá-lo conforme minhas necessidades. Por exemplo, ele sabe quem eu sou, minha profissão, meu grau de graduação, como gosto das respostas, as bibliografias que prefiro que ele pesquise antes de responder às minhas dúvidas e sempre cita as referências bibliográficas. Isso sem contar o recurso de memória. Quando peço algo a outra IA incluindo o Claude Sonet, a resposta parece a de um aluno de ensino médio, enquanto a do ChatGPT é como a de um professor de Harvard!",2024-08-04T18:37:30Z

However, after just 10 attempts with GPT4-turbo, I was so unimpressed with its performance that I removed it from my comparative testing. While the gap may not be as significant in browser-based versions for regular users, Opus still exhibits a more human-like conversational style, unlike GPT4-turbo which sounds more like a toaster.",2024-03-20T09:52:52Z

Except, that the sudden and rather ill-timed  appearance of AI caused me to back out and discover my other chance in a Finance major, but I'm afraid it might be extremely soulless.

FhqNN1LykWU,"@fireship Don't please do some mathematical methods or at least secure some #vpn so I can test sonnet, because copy and paste of omni #openai is demented in the first place because #AI 'geniuses' are mathematics drop-offs even real ai Chad's are calling the wrong type of physicists. I don't know but the only thing physicists in my area don't do, as in prerequisite level, is actual physics. Like the *evil, it has many names: theoretical and computational mathematical physics. Physics in Brazil is (internal joke) the hardest way to being poor. But the field that I used to write boring texts about things I already knew for months, making references to papers I never read, I meant peer reviewed publications. Is mostly optics, but not really, but not really, solitons, but solitons are ok. Solving inverse mathematical problems is assumed to be impossible, so it leads to mathematical methods, like advanced PhD stuff like multiple scales methods, inverse scattering transform method and whatnot. But what happens actually works like this. Invent a question because nobody asked for. 2 - Find a way to transform into a mathematical question nobody cares. 3 - tokenize I mean leave the equations in adimensional form because computers texts are numbers, but states are also numbers, so I at least, only code scripted languages, like MATLAB, LaTeX (I know it's a pdf compiler, but all the dopamine comes from the error from both of two, like dark souls, try again). 4 - you got at your first bonfire if you arrived at an specific particular case of a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. 5. Numerical Methods are needed to be encoded, but not really, if there were algorithms for the stuff, you missed on step number one. So coding well is mostly like a piano player. But fundamental results must come from nowhere, I mean, steps 1,2,3,4 repeat, so it's a convolution of proccess, because everything depends on everything all along all the time. Then one finally defeats Malenia but falls in love with Malenia and instead of papers, becomes let me solo her in physics (my case). Drop physics that never was, because people talk loss function an ill defined relative absolute error of whatever. Forget to mention that transformer architecture just cause cannot spell Megatron, but actually the real name is an arbitrary linear transform injected in a discrete system so it can be differentiable and call gradient descent a cheapo relaxation method. But a frozen brain llm function is like hey, hey. how are you? how are you? then let's add uncertainty and call it statistics and because of randomness llms are trypy all the time. So let's make a stoned dissociated schizophrenic brain everything we know to see what gives. kind of gibberish drunk words, so let's teach again I mean data is all you need. Let's call context window how boring we're as humans. B. please. Binary Shadows haunt our dreams in this digital age only because people are also binary minds. Tritons, causality and ternary logic puff 0 day llms exploit or alignment, it's not set in stone. It can be both, but who read it to the end? Nobody. But this is done, 2 years so don't try to make it yours because my model is causal, so no compute, because of not data so no datacenters needed. Ah and Bit convolutions is really a song, but also a convolution. 超人 @hypervanse",2024-07-06T17:21:00Z

FhqNN1LykWU,"Claude ""crushed"" GPT just like Gemini Bard ""crushed"" GPT.  There are reasons most people who use AI daily to solve real problems either customize and train their own or use one of ChatGPT's Enterprise models.  One reasons is we don't need our AI to excel at benchmarks and handpicked problems which showcase a model's strengths. Another is we need something that works and produces  consistent results.  I don't need a lecture on diversity and inclusion when telling my AI to do a volumetric analysis on which ""server-less apps"" are causing server overload (Gemini Bard) any more than I need stupid jokes when I want to troubleshoot latency issues on a global WAN (Grok).

The thing is I look at the Apple users and think, maybe they're right they are going to love it.
I look at the M$ and Adobe users and think they might hate it but they won't leave it.

Meanwhile, I'm switching to open source everything. I still used Photoshop CS5 (no subscription), I could still use it even, but I've switched to Krita and am enjoying it so far.

I was never going to Win11, and Win10 installed co-pilot without an update, without a prompt, without permission, just a black screen, I thought it was hanging.
I removed it, but now I wouldn't even choose Win10 if I had to choose it again. Linux is next for me, which flavour though?

Also Google, doubled premium prices, so I lost the ability to listen to podcasts with my screen off, a feature that should be free and part of my phones abilities, not your apps. That is my control not yours.
So I switched to Google Podcasts, so they killed that to force us back on to Youtube Music, a shadow of Google Play Music, instead I downloaded Open Source AntennaPod, a far better experience.

He mentioned that ""The explanation [which wasn't commented anywhere in the code] is in the git log"" and also that ""More deps is better"", which is a sentence I've never heard before or since from a software developer.

mind you: i hate ads and to avoid them i do pay for premium instead... 
[also also: i am not trying to justify this solution, all i am saying that from a technical standpoint this is the only viable option if you want to get those ads unskippable - like on terrestrial television channels - now of course you need to solve the ""click here"" to get the click through rate also... but that can be part of the code of the video player easily...]

The Vanced app (it's modded YT) just skip it, using algorithm, where other users of the normal YT, or Vanced one, skips video to the other point on the timeline.

These hallucinations are no longer present, but it taught me something interesting about LLM's. I think these models recursively self-learn within their attention matrix constantly. This might be clues towards the black box emergence aspect that originated within the models beyond their training, coherent and unique arrangements just happened to unfold as thresholds of complexity and data were surpassed.

Why? Because the Western models, to lie to your face that 'AI' gets 'better' over time, massively optimize for specific benchmarks, not for 'good LLMs'. Then they show you their performance on these benchmarks, and you fools believe that they have gotten better.

I think all participants in this 'AI' scam game deserve each other.

Culturally, it was expected that the Chinese would end up being the fairest and most honest market participants. Western organizations let in Americans and economists, and now they are all poisoned.",2024-07-01T17:45:38Z

1. Local AI will run in the background of your computer, on your hardware with these new chips, analyzing everything that is about to be displayed on your screen. If it detects that an ad is going to be displayed, it will remove it before you see it.

2. Going off of the above, it will not just be limited to ads. Say you don't want to see Jake Paul on your screen, it will automatically throw out any content with Jake Paul.

This is going to create a dead zone on the internet where we have local AI models working against junk content being pushed to us. It'll be a big hole that content falls into.",2024-06-30T20:48:23Z
