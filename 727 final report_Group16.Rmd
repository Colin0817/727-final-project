## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Background

In recent years, the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has marked a significant breakthrough in the field of natural language
processing. With their exceptional capabilities in text generation and
comprehension, these models have found applications across a wide range
of industries.

As the technology evolves, paid subscription services such as ChatGPT
Plus and Claude Pro have emerged as a prominent business model for LLM
platforms. These services not only enhance functionality but also
attract a loyal user base by offering superior performance, exclusive
support, and unique features tailored to user needs.

However, with increasing market competition, understanding users’
experiences, emotional feedback, and core expectations from paid
services has become critical. Gaining insights into these aspects is
essential for optimizing service design, strengthening user engagement,
and crafting effective market strategies.

### 1.2 Project Goal

This study seeks to analyze the user experience and emotional feedback
of two prominent LLM paid services: ChatGPT Plus and Claude Pro. The
goal is to explore differences in user satisfaction and functional
requirements, with a focus on four key dimensions: **Usability**,
**Price**, **Support**, and **Performance**.

By examining these dimensions, the study aims to identify the strengths
and weaknesses of ChatGPT Plus and Claude Pro based on real user
experiences. The findings will provide valuable data to support service
enhancements and inform strategies for market competition.

### 1.3 Project Focus

In terms of user experience of paid LLM services, the following key
questions are raised in this study:

1.  **What is the user experience regarding LLM paid services? How do
    users emotionally perceive and respond to these services?**

2.  **Which specific features and aspects of premium services are most
    valued by users?**

By answering these questions, the study will sort out the core features
and feedback patterns of user experience and provide a scientific basis
for optimizing paid LLM services.

## 2 Data Collection and Dataset Characteristics

This section describes our data collection from four major platforms:
App Store, Google Play, Reddit, and YouTube. The dataset comprises user
feedback and discussions about the paid subscription plans of ChatGPT
and Claude.

### 2.1 Platform Selection

We selected four platforms for their distinct characteristics in user
engagement.

**App Store** is Apple's official application marketplace designed for
iOS devices and stands as one of the world's earliest mobile application
stores. Users can download both free and paid applications, provide
ratings, and write reviews that help other users understand app quality
and applicability. The platform's review system provides direct user
feedback about app experiences.

**Google Play**, developed as Google's official application marketplace
for Android devices, functions similarly to the App Store. Users can
contribute reviews and ratings through their Google accounts,
facilitating community interaction. Both these application marketplaces
enable us to directly access user experiences with the ChatGPT and
Claude apps.

**Reddit** is a community-driven social news and discussion platform
that organizes content through "subreddits," covering topics from
technology to entertainment. Users can post content and comments, with
visibility determined by upvoting and downvoting mechanisms. Reddit's
highly active communities facilitate in-depth discussions and experience
sharing. Notably, Reddit's greater openness compared to App Store and
Goodle Play makes it particularly suitable for collecting public
opinions and analyzing various topics. Many users have shared
comprehensive experiences and discussions about ChatGPT and Claude's
paid plans on Reddit, making it a valuable data source.

**YouTube**, acquired by Google in 2006, is the world's largest
video-sharing platform. It allows users to upload, watch, comment on,
and share videos. YouTube's powerful search engine and recommendation
algorithms help users discover relevant content. Users can like videos,
comment, or subscribe to channels to interact with content creators.
Videos related to LLM usage methods, experience demonstrations, updates,
and development trends maintain considerable popularity on YouTube.
Content creators often produce more diverse or in-depth videos to
increase views and likes, resulting in potentially different
characteristics from the other three platforms.

### 2.2 Data Collection Methodology

### 2.2.1 Data Collection

For systematic data collection, we implemented an API-based approach.
The collection period spans from October 1, 2023, to October 1, 2024. To
ensure relevance to our research objectives, we employed specific
keyword filters for each platform.

For the application marketplaces (App Store and Google Play), we
targeted reviews containing keywords such as *"plus," "chatgpt plus,"
"gpt plus," "upgrade," "premium," "chatgptplus," "gptplus,"* and
*"gpt4"* for ChatGPT-related content.

For Claude-related content, we searched for terms including *"plus,"
"pro," "claude pro," "upgrade," "premium,"* and *"claudepro."*

For content-sharing platforms (Reddit and YouTube), we modified our
keyword strategy to accommodate their broader discussion format.
ChatGPT-related searches included *"gpt plus," "chatgpt premium,"
"chatgpt plus," "chatgpt upgrade," "gpt-4," "gpt4,"* and *"gptplus."*
Claude-related searches focused on *"claude pro," "claude premium,"* and
*"claude upgrade."*

### 2.2.2 API Implementation

Each platform required a specific API approach.

The App Store data collection utilized RSS API, based on XML or JSON
standards. This public API allowed access to user reviews, though with
certain extraction limitations.

For Google Play, we employed the Google Play Scraper Library, a
semi-public tool requiring adherence to platform usage policies and
anti-scraping guidelines.

Reddit's official API provided access to posts and comments through
OAuth authentication, ensuring data collection complied with platform
standards.

YouTube's official API required registration keys and operated under
specific usage quotas, allowing access to video content and associated
comments.

### 2.3 Dataset Characteristics

The final dataset comprises 11,148 comments distributed across platforms
with the following distribution:

App Store yielded 193 ChatGPT-related reviews and 219 Claude-related
reviews, providing insights from iOS users.

Google Play contributed a larger sample with 1,902 ChatGPT-related
reviews and 1,109 Claude-related reviews from Android users.

Reddit, offering the largest sample, provided 3,559 ChatGPT-related
comments and 2,006 Claude-related comments, reflecting its active
community discussion environment.

YouTube maintained a balanced sample with 1,080 comments each for both
ChatGPT and Claude-related content. The overview of collected data is
presented in the following table:

**Table 1 Overview of Data Collection Across Platforms**

![](images/198101733962831_.pic.jpg)

The dataset includes various data fields such as user ratings, textual
comments, publication time stamps, and platform-specific metrics,
enabling multifaceted analysis of user experiences and preferences
regarding LLM model subscriptions.

## 3 Research Methods

### 3.1 Supervised Learning Method for Keyword Matching

In the study of text analysis and cause extraction, we employ a
supervised learning approach based on keyword matching to identify user
comments that address specific research dimensions. A multidimensional
dictionary of key concepts wasemployed, encompassing four primary
dimensions: Price, Performance, Support, and Usability. Below is a
detailed description of each dimension:

**Price:** The Price dimension examines users’ perceptions and
evaluations of service pricing. Keywords were selected to encompass
common price-related expressions found in user reviews, ranging from
positive terms (e.g., “affordable,” “worth,” “inexpensive”) to negative
feedback (e.g., “expensive,” “costly”). This approach captures various
aspects of price perception, including its reasonableness,
cost-effectiveness, and subscription fees. The keyword “subscription” is
particularly focused on subscription-based payment models to analyze
user feedback regarding long-term payment experiences.

*Keywords: price, cost, expensive, cheap, value, affordable, worth,
free, subscription, costly, inexpensive, budget.*

**Performance:** The Performance dimension addresses the technical
performance of a service, including system responsiveness, accuracy,
reliability, and processing power. Keywords like “speed” and “lag”
reflect concerns about service smoothness, while “accuracy” and
“correctness” highlight users’ expectations of precision and
professionalism in service outputs. Additionally, terms such as “limit”
and “delay” capture user experiences related to technical bottlenecks or
service limitations.

*Keywords: performance, speed, efficient, quality, accuracy, reliable,
lag, fast, smooth, slow, output, limit, limited, delay, quick, correct,
reliability.*

**Support:** The Support dimension focuses on users’ interactions with
the service provider, emphasizing the efficiency of problem resolution,
quality of technical support, and responsiveness of customer service.
Keywords like “customer service” and “response time” reflect users’
expectations regarding timely assistance, while terms such as “bugs” and
“troubleshooting” indicate concerns about technical problem management.

*Keywords: support, customer service, help, responsive, team, issues,
bug, contact, solve, response time, feedback, documentation, helpful,
troubleshooting, assistance, FAQ.*

**Usability:** The Usability dimension highlights the ease and
intuitiveness of user interactions with the platform. Keywords such as
“easy” and “intuitive” reflect users’ evaluations of user-friendliness,
while “interface” and “design” focus on the aesthetics and functionality
of the platform's design. Additionally, terms like “learning curve” and
“customization” provide insights into users’ experiences with adapting
to and personalizing the platform.

*Keywords: easy, intuitive, interface, design, user-friendly, simple,
complex, accessible, learning curve, interaction, navigation, setup,
customization.*

We applied these keywords sequentially to various datasets from
different application platforms (e.g., ChatGPT and Claude user reviews
on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store) and social media platforms
(e.g., user reviews of ChatGPT and Claude on YouTube and Reddit). Using
string matching and pattern recognition techniques, we filtered and
categorized review texts by dimension. The extraction process generated
eight distinct comment sets for each platform and model, corresponding
to the four research dimensions outlined above.

### 3.2 Sentiment Analysis Using the AFINN Lexicon

The AFINN lexicon, developed by Finnish researcher Finn Årup Nielsen, is
a widely used sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for text
sentiment evaluation. This lexicon comprises a collection of common
English words and phrases, each assigned an integer sentiment score that
reflects its emotional intensity and polarity.

To analyze sentiment, each word in the user comments is matched against
the entries in the AFINN lexicon. The corresponding sentiment scores are
then assigned to the comments based on the matched words. Using these
scores, the comments are categorized into three sentiment states:

-   **Positive**: Sentiment score \> 0

-   **Negative**: Sentiment score \< 0

-   **Neutral**: Sentiment score = 0

### 3.3 Twitter-RoBERTa Model Based on Hugging Face

To analyze social media data, we utilized the Twitter-RoBERTa model from
CardiffNLP, available on the Hugging Face platform. This model is
specifically optimized for social media text and supports fine-grained
sentiment classification into three categories: **Positive**,
**Negative**, and **Neutral**.

The Twitter-RoBERTa model is trained on a large corpus of tweet data,
making it well-suited for sentiment analysis of user comments. After
preprocessing the data, we applied the model to extract both the
sentiment tendencies (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and their associated
confidence scores.

Since the model outputs sentiment predictions using coded labels in the
format `LABEL_x` (where x$\in$[1,2,3]), we mapped these labels to their
corresponding sentiment tendencies for clarity.

## 4 Data Analysis

### 4.1 Analysis of Overall Sentiment and Reasons Among Users

This study integrates data from multiple platforms to evaluate the
emotional attitudes of paid users toward ChatGPT and Claude. The
analysis begins with an overall assessment of user sentiment and
proceeds to examine the two models across four evaluation dimensions.
Furthermore, the relationship between users’ emotional attitudes and
specific reasons is explored to understand the distribution of
sentiments across the four dimensions.

### 4.1.1 What Is the Overall Emotional Attitude of Paid Subscribers Towards Both Models?

Figure 1 presents a comparison of the emotional attitudes of paid users
toward ChatGPT and Claude. The data indicates that ChatGPT has a
significantly higher proportion of positive sentiment compared to
Claude, suggesting that most users express greater satisfaction with its
service experience.

However, the difference in negative sentiment between the two models is
minimal. ChatGPT exhibits a slightly higher proportion of negative
sentiment, indicating that while most users are satisfied, some express
greater dissatisfaction with its service compared to Claude.

Additionally, ChatGPT shows a marginally higher proportion of neutral
sentiment. This finding may reflect that some users perceive its service
as meeting, but not exceeding, their expectations.

**Figure 1 Sentiment Attitudes of Paid Users toward ChatGPT and Claude**

### 4.1.2 What Are the Most Common Keywords Mentioned by Users of the Two Models?

Pricing is the most frequently mentioned factor by users, with ChatGPT
receiving particularly high attention in this area (Figure 2). This
indicates that users are more sensitive to pricing when evaluating
ChatGPT and have higher expectations for cost-effective services. In
contrast, Claude shows a relatively low percentage of mentions regarding
pricing, which may suggest that its users are either more accepting of
its current pricing model or less concerned about pricing as a critical
factor.

Regarding performance, ChatGPT is mentioned significantly more often
than Claude. This trend reflects users’ higher expectations for
ChatGPT's responsiveness, accuracy, and stability.

Mentions of support services are also notably higher for ChatGPT
compared to Claude. This trend could point to two potential
interpretations: either users rely more heavily on ChatGPT’s customer
support services, or they provide more feedback on the platform’s
support quality, including suggestions for further improvement.

In the dimension of usability, mentions for Claude are slightly higher
than for ChatGPT. This indicates that paid users are more focused on
Claude’s interface design, ease of operation, and overall
user-friendliness. While ChatGPT users appear to provide less feedback
on usability, this does not necessarily imply lower satisfaction.

### 4.2 Sentiment Comparison of ChatGPT and Claude Users Across Platforms in Four Dimensions

### 4.2.1 Do Users on Different Platforms Share Similar Attitudes Toward the Two Models?

Both ChatGPT and Claude receive high positive ratings across various
platforms. The proportion of positive reviews on the App Store and
Google Play is significantly higher than on Reddit and YouTube. This
disparity may reflect differences in user review behaviors across
platforms: users on the App Store and Google Play tend to leave reviews
when they are either extremely satisfied or dissatisfied, often skewing
toward extremes. In contrast, social media platforms like Reddit and
YouTube feature more diverse and balanced reviews.

As shown in Figure 5, reviews on the App Store and Google Play are
predominantly positive, with lower proportions of negative and neutral
reviews. This suggests that users on these platforms are generally more
satisfied with their overall experience of both ChatGPT and Claude.
Conversely, on Reddit and YouTube, paid users show higher proportions of
negative and neutral sentiment, with Reddit particularly standing out
for its high percentage of negative reviews.

When comparing ChatGPT and Claude, we can find that ChatGPT has a higher
percentage of positive sentiment than Claude on Reddit and YouTube.
Claude, on the other hand, experiences a notably higher percentage of
negative sentiment, with the peak observed on Reddit.

On App Store and Google Play platforms, Claude slightly outperforms
ChatGPT in terms of positive sentiment, indicating that its user
experience on these platforms is relatively well-received. However,
Claude still shows a higher proportion of negative sentiment compared to
ChatGPT, suggesting that it may not fully meet user expectations in

**Figure 6 Cross-Platform Sentiment Distribution in Four Dimensions:
Claude vs. ChatGPT**

### 4.2.3 Do Users Across Platforms Share Similar Emotional Attitudes Toward the Dimensions of the Two Models?

To thoroughly understand the experiences of paid users and their reasons
for choosing different LLM models, we analyzed the percentage
distribution of sentiments (positive, neutral, and negative) across four
dimensions and visualized the results using heat maps. These heat maps,
based on user comment data from four platforms, provide insights into
sentiment trends.

Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the distribution of positive sentiment across
platforms and dimensions.

On the App Store and Google Play platforms, the proportion of positive
user comments for the four dimensions of both ChatGPT and Claude is
relatively high, as indicated by the green shading on the heat map. This
reflects a generally high level of user satisfaction with the two models
on these platforms. In contrast, on Reddit and YouTube, the proportion
of positive sentiment is lower, represented by purple on the heat map.
This suggests that users on these social media platforms are inclined to
share less favorable views of both ChatGPT and Claude.

For ChatGPT, sentiment data from the App Store and Google Play platforms
differ significantly from those of Reddit and YouTube, reflecting large
fluctuations in user emotional feedback across platforms. In comparison,
Claude’s heat map shows a more even color distribution, indicating
greater consistency in user sentiment across platforms.

Both ChatGPT and Claude demonstrate higher proportions of positive
sentiment in the Usability dimension. Notably, ChatGPT outperforms
Claude in positive Usability feedback across all platforms, reflecting
stronger user satisfaction with its interface design and ease of
operation. ChatGPT exhibits some platform-based differences in positive
sentiment for the Performance dimension, with weaker performance
specifically noted on the YouTube platform. Claude has a lower
proportion of positive sentiment in the Price dimension compared to
ChatGPT, reinforcing earlier findings that pricing remains a significant
pain point for Claude users. Both models show similar positive sentiment
proportions in the Support dimension, indicating a perceived balance in
user support services between ChatGPT and Claude.

**Figure 8 Positive Sentiment Proportions for Claude**

Using the share of negative sentiment expressed by users towards ChatGPT
and Claude across the four dimensions, heat maps (Figures 9 and 10) were
generated to visualize the distribution of users' negative feedback
across platforms.

The share of negative sentiment for ChatGPT varies significantly across
dimensions and platforms, with some reaching nearly 1.0. On the YouTube
platform, the Price and Support dimensions show the highest percentages
of negative sentiment, suggesting that users are especially dissatisfied
with these aspects.

Claude exhibits a lower share of negative sentiment compared to ChatGPT,
indicating relatively higher user satisfaction. However, certain areas
still require attention. On the YouTube platform, the Price dimension
displays a high proportion of negative sentiment, nearing 0.6. This
suggests that pricing remains a significant pain point for Claude users,
who may feel that the cost of the service does not align with its
perceived value.

## **5 Conclusion**

### 5.1 Comparative Analysis of Core Features

The analysis of user comments across platforms reveals distinct patterns
in user perceptions of ChatGPT and Claude, particularly regarding their
core features and functionality. This section presents key findings,
organized by major themes and platform-specific insights.

Overall, ChatGPT receives more positive feedback compared to Claude. The
most significant positive comments about ChatGPT are focused on the
performance and support dimensions, indicating that users are generally
satisfied with its technical performance and the quality of assistance
provided. On the other hand, Claude receives consistent positive
feedback on its support features. User comments frequently highlight
that Claude has unique advantages in customer support and problem
solving.

A notable observation is that price is one of the most important factors
for LLM users. Despite both models having the same monthly paid plans,
users' perceptions of the price for ChatGPT and Claude differ
significantly. The analysis shows that price is a major pain point for
Claude, with many users expressing dissatisfaction. In contrast, ChatGPT
enjoys a more favorable perception of its pricing, although it remains a
concern for some users. This suggests that, for most users, ChatGPT's
paid plans are seen as offering better value for money. This may be
attributed to ChatGPT's strong performance in terms of output speed,
quality, and reliability, which better meets the needs of LLM users,
leading to an overall more positive paid experience.

### 5.2 Platform-Specific Comment Characteristics and Comparison

The analysis of user comments across four platforms—App Store, Google
Play, Reddit, and YouTube—highlights distinct differences in user
behavior, expectations, and feedback styles unique to each platform.

First, there is a clear contrast in the emotional tone of comments
between application marketplaces and content-sharing platforms. On App
Store and Google Play, users tend to provide either highly positive or
negative feedback, with little emphasis on neutral or constructive
criticism. This can be attributed to the review-based structure of these
platforms, where users are focused on offering a general evaluation of
the service. In contrast, Reddit and YouTube offer a wider range of
emotional tones, with users providing more balanced feedback, including
constructive criticism and recognition of both strengths and weaknesses.
This diversity of sentiment makes feedback on Reddit and YouTube more
valuable for identifying areas of improvement.

Another key difference lies in the focus on service dimensions. App
Store and Google Play users primarily concentrate on performance and
price, with the emphasis on price being especially strong on Google
Play. In contrast, Reddit and YouTube users demonstrate a more balanced
focus across all four dimensions, but place particular emphasis on
support and usability for Claude. This indicates that Reddit and YouTube
users are more critical of Claude's usability and customer support and
are more likely to provide detailed feedback on these aspects, whereas
users on App Store and Google Play focus more on the overall value and
functionality of the service.4.3 

### 5.3 Recommendations for Enhancing LLM User Experience

Based on the analysis, we can draw several key recommendations for
enhancing user experience with LLM models.

First, it is essential to clearly identify and address the core needs of
users. When developing paid plans, a strong focus should be placed on
optimizing model performance and actively promoting these improvements.
A reasonable balance between performance and pricing is critical, as
users expect high performance and fair pricing. If users purchase a paid
plan but are dissatisfied with the service, they are more likely to
leave negative feedback, which can negatively affect the model's
reputation.

Second, user support and interface design remain key areas for improving
the overall user experience. Faster, more efficient support services can
significantly enhance user satisfaction, while a more aesthetically
pleasing, user-friendly interface makes the model easier to use.
Offering both effective support and a well-designed, intuitive interface
will contribute to positive user experiences and improve retention.

Finally, when collecting user feedback, special attention should be
given to the insights shared on content-sharing platforms. Unlike
application marketplaces, which often incentivize reviews and lead to
either very brief comments or an inflated number of positive reviews,
content-sharing platforms provide a more open environment where users
can freely express a variety of opinions. These platforms tend to offer
more balanced and objective feedback, which can help better identify
pain points and areas for improvement that may be overlooked on
review-based platforms.

### 5.4 Possible Limitations

While the analysis provides valuable insights into user perceptions of
ChatGPT and Claude, there are several limitations that should be
considered:

### 5.4.1 Difficulty in Determining Paid Users

One of the main challenges in this analysis is the difficulty in
identifying whether users are paying customers. Many platforms do not
provide clear distinctions between free and paid users in the comments.
Without this information, it becomes challenging to isolate feedback
from users who are paying for the service, potentially skewing the
understanding of user satisfaction across different segments.

### 5.4.2 Limited App Store Reviews

Due to restrictions on scraping reviews from the App Store, only a
limited number of reviews were accessible for analysis. This restriction
means that the analysis of App Store comments is based on a smaller
sample size, which could affect the reliability of the insights drawn
from this platform compared to others with more extensive feedback.

### 5.4.3 Comparison Limited to Two LLM Models

Another limitation is that the analysis only compares two LLM models,
ChatGPT and Claude. While this provides useful insights into the user
experience with these two models, it does not allow for a broader
comparison across other available LLMs. Including additional models in
the analysis could help identify trends that apply to the broader LLM
